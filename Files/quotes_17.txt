Go placidly amid the noise and the haste  and remember what peace there may be in silence. As far as possible without surrender  be on good terms with all persons. Speak your truth quietly and clearly  and listen to others  even the dull and ignorant  they too have their story. . . . Be yourself. Especially do not feign affection. Neither be cynical about love  for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment it is as perennial as the grass. Take kindly the counsel of the years  gracefully surrendering the things of youth.

Beyond a wholesome discipline  be gentle with yourself. You are a child of the universe no less than the trees and the stars  you have a right to be here. And whether or not it is clear to you  no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should.

Neither be cynical about love - for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment it is as perennial as the grass. Take kindly the counsel of the years  gracefully surrendering the things of youth.

Beyond a wholesome discipline  be gentle with yourself. You are a child of the universe no less than the trees and the stars  you have a right to be here. And whether or not it is clear to you  no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should.

There is today an extraordinary interest with the data of modern experience per se. Our absorption in our contemporary historical state is very high right now. It's not altogether unlike a similar situation in seventeenth century Holland  where wealthy merchants wanted their portraits done with all their blemishes included. It is the height of egotism  in a sense  to think even one's blemishes are of significance.

In writing the book  I am living. I am growing. I am tapping myself. I am changing. The process is the product. - Theodore Isaac Rubin

When you're a writer  you no longer see things with the freshness of the normal person. There are always two figures that work inside you  and if you are at all intelligent you realize that you have lost something. But I think there has always been this dichotomy in a real writer.

My own experience is that once a story has been written  one has to cross out the beginning and the end. It is there that we authors do most of our lying . . . one must ruthlessly suppress everything that is not concerned with the subject.

Anybody can find out if he is a writer. If he were a writer  when he tried to write of some particular day  he would find in the effort that he could recall exactly how the light fell and how the temperature felt  and all the quality of it. Most people cannot do it. If they can do it  they may never be successful in a pecuniary sense  but that ability is at the bottom of writing  I am sure. - Maxwell Perkins
I believe the writer... should always be the final judge. I have always held to that position and have sometimes seen books hurt thereby  but at least as often helped. The book belongs to the author. - Maxwell Perkins

A memorandum is written to protect the writer - not to inform his reader. - Dean Acheson

An editor should tell the author his writing is better than it is. Not a lot better  a little better. - T. S. Eliot

To keep clear of concealment  to keep clear of the need of concealment  to do nothing that he might not do out on the middle of Boston Common at noonday -I cannot say how more and more that seems to me to be the glory of a young man's life. It is an awful hour when the first necessity of hiding anything comes. The whole life is different thenceforth. When there are questions to be feared and eyes to be avoided and subjects that must not be touched  then the bloom of life is gone. Put off that day as long as possible. Put if off forever if you can. - Phillips Brooks

Age  I do abhor thee  youth  I do adore thee. - William Shakespeare

Here too, as in the Commune almost a century earlier, the struggle was articulated around the hope that 'the antithesis between the everyday and the Festival--whether of labour or of leisure--will no longer be a basis for society. - Tom McDonough, The Situationists and the City: A Reader
The new towns of the 1950s and '60s were nothing less than the spatial translation of alienation and control and in these cities power increasingly could relinquish the old forms of advertising in favor of 'the simple organization of the spectacle of objects of consumption, which will only have consumable value illusory to the extent to which they will first of all have been objects of spectacle' -- to the extent, that is, they have first appeared on the television screen, which henceforth had to be seen as an urbanistic tool in its own right. - Tom McDonough, The Situationists and the City: A Reader
One of my greatest obsessions is the lights of a city. Through my eyes there is nothing so delicious and rich and lovely. - K.B. Ezzell, Elysium
As filthy as any night was, a New York City morning is always clean. The eyes get washed.Flowers in white deli buckets are replenished. The population bathes, in marble mausoleums of Upper East Side showers, or in Greenwich Village tubs, or in the sink of a Chinatown one-bedroom crammed with fifteen people. Some bar opens and the first song on the jukebox is Johnny Thunders, while bums pick up cigarette butts to see what's left to smoke. The smell of espresso and hot croissants. The weather vane squeaks in the sun. Pigeons are reborn out of the mouths of blue windows. - Jardine Libaire, White Fur
A bus drives past and I'm nauseated by a whiff of exhaust. Then rotting fish. The rancid stench of sewage. Is it garbage day? I'm trapped in the pungent fog, in the dreary suburban-style shops, the rat race of city life. The city, even on the west coast, has the power to beat us down, to suck us of passion, to crush our dreams. - Shannon  Mullen, See What Flowers
This is a little parable about cities and genres; how, while some of them lose their imaginative centrality, others take their place. - Amit Chaudhuri, Calcutta: Two Years in the City
In the streets of Cecilia, an illustrious city, I met once a goatherd, driving a tinkling flock along the walls."Man blessed by heaven," he asked me, stopping, "can you tell me the name of the city in which we are?""May the gods accompany you!" I cried. "How can you fail to recognise the illustrious city of Cecilia?""Bear with me," that man answered. "I am a wandering herdsman. Sometimes my goats and I have to pass through cities; but we are unable to distinguish them. Ask me the names of the grazing lands: I know them all, the Meadow between the Cliffs, the Green Slope, the Shadowed Grass. Cities have no name for me: they are places without leaves, separating one pasture from another, and where the goats are frightened at street corners and scatter. The dog and I run to keep the flock together.""I am the opposite of you," I said. "I recognise only cities and cannot distinguish what is outside them. In uninhabited places each stone and each clump of grass mingles, in my eyes, with every stone and clump. - Italo Calvino, Invisible Cities
She could hear her hair growing. It sounded like something crumbling. A burnt thing crumbling. Coal. Toast. Moths crisped on a light bulb. She remembered reading somewhere that even after people died, their hair and nails kept growing. Like starlight, travelling through the universe long after the stars themselves had died. Like cities. Fizzy, effervescent, simulating the illusion of life while the planet they had plundered died around them. - Arundhati Roy, The Ministry of Utmost Happiness
She thought of the city at night, of cities at night. Discarded constellations of old stars, fallen from the sky, rearranged on Earth in patterns and pathways and towers. Invaded by weevils that have learned to walk upright. - Arundhati Roy, The Ministry of Utmost Happiness
Wellâ€¦ er -â€â€œExpecting a rescue is beyond hope under the circumstances!â€ Sam Barthoff, Mayor of Atro City, interrupted grimly, throwing up his hands in hopelessness. â€œHopeless! - Christina Engela, High Steaks
Where do you go if you don't belong anywhere? If I wanted to run away then why come to the city? Because this is the place to hide. This is the place to be invisible. Anyone can be no one here, and I am someone that wants to be no one. - Steven Wilson
Streets that follow like a tedious argumentOf insidious intentTo lead you to an overwhelming question... - T.S. Eliot, The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock and Other Poems
To love is to destroy, and that to be loved is to be destroyed - Cassandra Clare, City of Bones
I could hear it from far away, that sound which only very big cities can produce: a sound consisting of all sounds rolled into one: the hum of voices and the cries of animals, bells ringing and the chink of coins, children's laughter and hammers beating metal, knives and forks clattering and a thousand doors slamming - the grandiose sound of life, of birth and death, itself. - Walter Moers, The 13Â½ Lives of Captain Bluebear
But this city is a world of its own, a country within a country. People are used to taking the old and making it news; and used, too, to taking the new and making it old. Every glass of water from its taps, it is said, has passed six times through the kidneys of another, and every scrap of its land has been trodden on, fought over, dug up and broken down for centuries. - Amanda Craig, Hearts and Minds
The San Francisco skyline sparkles in the distance, the bay spread out before it like a shark-infested welcome mat. - T.T. Monday, Double Switch
I like the idea of living in a city - any city, especially a strange one - like the thought of traffic and crowds, of working in a bookstore, waiting tables in a coffee shop, who knew what kind of odd, solitary life I might slip into? Meals alone, waling the dogs in the evenings; and nobody knowing who I was. - Donna Tartt, The Secret History
There are times when Los Angeles is the most magical city on Earth. When the Santa Ana winds sweep through and the air is warm and so, so clear. When the jacaranda trees bloom in the most brilliant lilac violet. When the ocean sparkles on a warm February day and you're pushing fine grains of sand through your bare toes while the rest of the country is hunkered down under blankets slurping soup. But other times, like when the jacaranda trees drop their blossoms in an eerie purple rain, Los Angeles feels like only a half-formed dream. Like perhaps the city was founded as a strip mall in the early 1970s and has no real reason to exist. An afterthought from the designer of some other, better city. A playground made only for attractive people to eat expensive salads. - Steven Rowley, Lily and the Octopus
She knows she is in Chicago. But she does not yet realize that she is in Illinois. - Lydia Davis, Can't and Won't: Stories
In our broad sweep, the city looks like a single gigantic creature - or more like a single collective entity created by many intertwining organism. Countless arteries stretch to the ends of its elusive body, circulating a continuous supply of fresh blood cells, sending out new data and collecting the old, sending out new consumables and collecting the old, sending out new contradictions and collecting the old. To the rhythm of its pulsing, all parts of the body flicker and flare up and squirm. Midnight is approaching, and while the peak of activity has passed, the basal metabolism that maintains life continues undiminished, producing the basso continuo of the city's moan, a monotonous sound that neither rises nor falls but is pregnant with foreboding. - Haruki Murakamiurakami
The city had been built by people from innumerable elsewheres. It was a chaos of cultures ordered only by its long streets. It belonged to no one and never would, or maybe it was a million cities in one, unique to each of its inhabitants, belonging to whoever walked its streets. - AndrÃ© Alexis, The Hidden Keys
Allowing ourselves to become pure point of view, we hang in midair over the city. What we see now is a gigantic metropolis waking up. Commuter trains of many colors move in all directions, transporting people from place to place. Each of those under transport is a human being with a different face and mind, and at the same time each is a nameless part of the collective identity. Each is simultaneously a self-contained whole and a mere part. Handling this dualism of theirs skillfully and advantageously, they perform their morning rituals with deftness and precision: brushing teeth, shaving, tying neckties, applying lipstick. They check the morning news on TV, exchange words with their families, eat, defecate. - Haruki Murakami, After Dark
for the first time I am confronted with the fact that places and people are like things: both made of memories and meaningful to us in the same way: we construct ourselves in our conversations with them. - Bilal Tanweer, The Scatter Here Is Too Great
It is not an individual act, architecture. You have to consider your client. Only out of that can you produce great architecture. You cannot work in the abstract. - I.M. Pei
Life is architecture and architecture is the mirror of life. - I.M. Pei
He needed to get away from the rush of the city, from the unceasing noise and annoying obligations. - Francine Rivers, A Voice in the Wind
I was born in a slum, but the slum wasn't born in me. - Jesse Jackson
Things taste sweeter when you have some hunger left to linger. You feel it hunting your head for buried things -  digging into the fractures of your breath warm and greedy.
a city is all about how you look at it - Bilal Tanweer
My dear, you are not one person. You have many people in you, and each one can ask only some kinds of questions. - Bilal Tanweer, The Scatter Here Is Too Great
Let's do it right. This is for the ages. - I.M. Pei
You cannot defend your design without knowing what you're designing for. - I.M. Pei
Well, maybe it started that way. As a dream, but doesn't everything. Those buildings. These lights. This whole city. Somebody had to dream about it first. And maybe that is what I did. I dreamed about coming here, but then I did it. - Roald Dahl, James and the Giant Peach
this was an environment built, not for man, but for man's absence. - J.G. Ballard, High-Rise
Without knowing it, he had constructed a gigantic vertical zoo, its hundreds of cages stacked above each other. All the events of the past few months made sense if one realised that these brilliant and exotic creatures had learned to open the doors. - J.G. Ballard, High-Rise
the ragged skyline of the city resembled the disturbed encephalograph of an unresolved mental crisis. - J.G. Ballard
It's a strange city... filled with things that are not obvious. - A.M. Homes, This Book Will Save Your Life
If you don't hear the crows of the roosters in the mornings, you are one cursed city fellow! - Mehmet Murat ildan
When I come back to you, if I come back to you, will I know you? Will you be the city of my memory? Or will you be a stranger? - Robert Jackson Bennett, City of Stairs
I will not see you, she tells the city, but I will remember you. - Robert Jackson Bennett, City of Stairs
All night, snow.Open the window,stretch my arms out.Keep my eyes openin the white, whipping wind.There are few cars on the highway.The river's frozen in places.In a city that never stops,I can hardly hear anything.For tonight, the city gives mewhat I need. - Cordelia Jensen, Skyscraping
The best thing to be in a city was anonymous. Failing that, however, notoriety would do. - Michael Swanwick, Chasing the Phoenix
An age-old city is like a pond. With its colours and reflections. Its chills and murk. Its ferment, its sorcery, its hidden life.A city is like a woman, with a woman's desires and dislikes. Her abandon and restraint. Her reserve - above all, her reserve.To get to the heart of a city, to learn its most subtle secrets, takes infinite tenderness, and patience sometimes to the point of despair. It calls for an artlessly delicate touch, a more or less unconditional love. Over centuries.Time works for those who place themselves beyond time.You're no true Parisian, you do not know your city, if you haven't experienced its ghosts. To become imbued with shades of grey, to blend into the drab obscurity of blind spots, to join the clammy crowd that emerges, or seeps, at certain times of day from the metros, railway stations, cinemas or churches, to feel a silent and distant brotherhood with the lonely wanderer, the dreamer in his shy solitude, the crank, the beggar, even the drunk - all this entails a long and difficult apprenticeship, a knowledge of people and places that only years of patient observation can confer. - Jacques Yonnet
My visage high above your city,Shines like gold, but half as pretty.Arms I've none, but hands I've two:Mondo, mini, black not blue.Climb my stairs and have no fears, All that threatens are my gears.Tucked beneath the mightly wheel,An envelpe shall truth reveal. - Megan Frazer Blakemore, The Friendship Riddle
Although my father had never been there, I came to believe I would someday see that city for him. - Alice Hoffman, The Marriage of Opposites
I could decorate a whole city with books! - Sima Mittal
We get so used to the gregarious nature of our towns and villages that we forget how crowded our existence has become. - Fennel Hudson, Wild Carp - Fennel's Journal - No. 4
There are great roads, beautiful bridges, lovely parks, gorgeous gardens and wonderful buildings in a big city. But there is something missing, something very important: The spirit of nature! - Mehmet Murat ildan
Every city has a single word that defines it, that identifies most poeple who live there. If you could read people's thoughts as they were passing you on the streets of any given place, you would discover that most of them are thinking the same thought. Whatever that majority thought might be - that is the word of the city. And if your personal word does not match the word of the city, then you don't really belong there. - Elizabeth Gilbert, Eat, Pray, Love
A city is more than a place in space, it is a drama in time - Patrick Geddes
I think no matter where you go, you'll be happy as long as you know why you're there. - Rachel Kapelke-Dale, Graduates in Wonderland: The International Misadventures of Two (Almost) Adults
...all this convinced him that he had come to one of those revolting havens where pathetic depravity makes its abode, born of tawdry education and the terrible populousness of the capital. One of those havens where man blasphemously crushes and derides all the pure and holy that adorns life, where woman, the beauty of the world, the crown of creation, turns into some strange, ambiguous being, where, along with purity of soul, she loses everything feminine and repulsively adopts all the mannerisms and insolence of a man, and ceases to be that weak, that beautiful being so different from us. - Nikolai Gogol, The Collected Tales of Nikolai Gogol
Since its sudden birth the city had expanded, swallowing up acre upon acre of the surrounding grasslands and drawing thousands into its domain. Hardly built on the most advantageous ground, miles from the open waters, decades from the mines at the mountain summits, it yet remained the only settlement of note on the isle. This sprawling mass of a city, once a compact kingdom, was now the keystone of the Castilian Empire. - R.D. Shanks, A Reverie of Brothers
It is perfectly banal to establish a city in the middle of nature but it is perfectly extraordinary to establish nature in the middle of a city! Ordinary nations do the first, extraordinary nations do the second! - Mehmet Murat ildan
And when spring comes to the City people notice one another in the road; notice the strangers with whom they share aisles and tables and the space where intimate garments are laundered. going in and out, in and out the same door, they handle the handle; on trolleys and park benches they settle thighs on a seat in which hundreds have done it too. Copper coins dropped in the palm have been swallowed by children and tested by gypsies, but it's still money and people smile at that. It's the time of year when the City urges contradiction most, encouraging you to buy street food when you have no appetite at all; giving you a taste for a single room occupied by you alone as well as a craving to share it with someone you passed in the street. Really there is no contradictionâ€”rather it's a condition; the range of what an artful City can do. What can beat bricks warming up to the sun? The return of awnings. The removal of blankets from horses' backs. Tar softens under the heel and the darkness under bridges changes from gloom to cooling shade. After a light rain, when the leaves have come, tree limbs are like wet fingers playing in woolly green hair. Motor cars become black jet boxes gliding behind hoodlights weakened by mist. On sidewalks turned to satin figures move shoulder first, the crowns of their heads angled shields against the light buckshot that the raindrops are. The faces of children glimpsed at windows appear to be crying, but it is the glass pane dripping that makes it seem so. - Toni Morrison, Jazz
The silhouettes of Lovat now dominated the skyline. Nine levels stretching skyward. Five hundred meters high at its apex. Each level housing buildings of various sizes sagged on the backs of buildings below. Thousands of sodium lamps twinkled in their recesses.Lovat was the oldest and largest city on the coast, and it showed its age by the haphazard mess it had become. Roads rose and dipped, elevators and staircases criss-crossed, and floors would end and then begin across the city leaving large empty spaces between levels. - K.M. Alexander, The Stars Were Right
We all tend to think of ourselves as the last unsinning inhabitants of whatever place we live in. We don't usually recognize ourselves as participants in its destruction. - David                  Owen, Green Metropolis: What the City Can Teach the Country About True Sustainability
Everything has been planned. The ascent will be completed in two days' time. He will climb another one hundred floors today. Another hundred the next day. He does not want to take the lift. The rush of life causes people to drown in the temporary. He wishes to dip into eternity before he leaves. - Isa Kamari, The Tower
For him, the kampung was a place to live and work that was based on a steadfast and intimate relationship between man and nature. The village was a true reflection of life in the tropics. - Isa Kamari, The Tower
This is what I've always loved about a city, all the worlds hidden away inside, largest of aquariums. - David Vann, Aquarium
Nice is a city of ghosts and specters, but I hope not to become one of them right away. - Patrick Modiano, Rue des boutiques obscures
What is the purpose of a city if not to grant the greatest of gifts, anonymity? - Rabih Alameddine, I, The Divine: A Novel in First Chapters
There's a saying that all roads lead to Ankh-Morpork, greatest of Discworld c - Terry Pratchett, Moving Pictures
Never follow the crowd....Until and unless you're crossing the road... - Sanhita Baruah
Cities also believe they are the work of the mind or of chance, but neither the one nor the other suffices to hold up their walls. You take delight not in a city's seven or seventy wonders, but in the answer it gives to a question of yours. or to the question it asks you, forcing you to answer, like Thebes through the mouth of the Sphinx. - Italo Calvino, Invisible Cities
So now I lye by Day and toss or rave by Night, since the ratling and perpetual Hum of the Town deny me rest: just as Madness and Phrensy are the vapours which rise from the lower Faculties, so the Chaos of the Streets reaches up even to the very Closet here and I am whirl'd about by cries of Knives to Grind and Here are your Mouse-Traps. I was last night about to enter the Shaddowe of Rest when a Watch-man, half-drunken, thumps at the Door with his Past Three-a-clock and his Rainy Wet Morning. And when at length I slipp'd into Sleep I had no sooner forgot my present Distemper than I was plunged into a worse: I dreamd my self to be lying in a small place under ground, like unto a Grave, and my Body was all broken while others sung. And there was a Face that did so terrifie me that I had like to have expired in my Dream. Well, I will say no more. - Peter Ackroyd, Hawksmoor
I walked the streets and tasted the golden sun that lay across the city. - Chaim Potok, My Name Is Asher Lev
Is your life really so bad? This city is full of opportunities â€“â€â€œCan you call it a city?â€ Marcus asked. â€œNo gymnasium, no theatre, no forum? Where is the life a Roman man should lead? - Matthew  Johnson, Irregular Verbs and Other Stories
A man should never wear shorts in the city. Flip-flops and shorts in the city are never appropriate. Shorts should only be worn on the tennis court or on the beach. - Tom Ford
There seems to be a different Chicago around every street corner, behind every bar, and within every apartment, two-flat, cottage, or bungalow. City of immigrants or city of heartless plutocrats, say what you will, Chicago almost defies interpretation. In many ways Chicago is like a snake that sheds its skin every thirty years or so and puts on a new coat to conform to a new reality. - Dominic A. Pacyga, Chicago: A Biography
@K11, Urban farming; It's something nice and warm for families and kids, but also references elements of the city. Urban Farming is very important for Shanghainese people because the city has lost its connection with nature. When you buy fruit or vegetables it's just that - a product - for kids and us, we wanted to reconnect this with the amazing process of growing plants. People need this, urban farming connects people with their roots. In this way it's also educational - Baris Gencel
Who said Hong Kong too small? In size perhaps but not in it`s soul and personality. Every corner in this city giving you full of surprises, if not every hour but at least every dayâ€¦. - Baris Gencel
â€¦my books are derived from city images, and the city of my dreams or nightmares is Mexico City. (The Art of Fiction, No. 68. The Paris Review, No. 82, Winter 1981.) - Carlos Fuentes
In photographs taken from the sky, cities resembled circuit boards. It was no surprise, really, that there were sparky misfirings, dangerous connections. Even traffic, Alice concluded, set up a kind of static in the air, let loose vibrations and uncontainable agitation. Freighted with more than they could absorb, with city intentions, citizens moved in designs of inexplicable purpose. - Gail Jones, Dreams Of Speaking
New York had saved him, in a very real way. It had pushed and prodded him with its impatient and sharp fingers, reminding him on a daily basis during that jittery first year that it didn't really give a goddamn whether he sank or swam. He liked its selfishness and its generosity and its propensity for flipping the bird to the rest of the world. - Nora Roberts, Key of Knowledge
Three years in London had not changed Richard, although it had changed the way he perceived the city. Richard had originally imagined London as a gray city, even a black city, from pictures he had seen, and he was surprised to find it filled with color. It was a city of red brick and white stone, red buses and large black taxis, bright red mailboxes and green grassy parks and cemeteries.It was a city in which the very old and the awkwardly new jostled each other, not uncomfortably, but without respect; a city of shops and offices and restaurants and homes, of parks and churches, of ignored monuments and remarkably unpalatial palaces; a city of hundreds of districts with strange names - Crouch End, Chalk Farm, Earl's Court, Marble Arch - and oddly distinct identities; a noisy, dirty, cheerful, troubled city, which fed on tourists, needed them as it despised them, in which the average speed of transportation through the city had not increased in three hundred years, following five hundred years of fitful road-widening and unskillful compromises between the needs of traffic, whether horse-drawn, or, more recently, motorized, and the need of pedestrians; a city inhabited by and teeming with people of every color and manner and kind. - Neil Gaiman, Neverwhere
An advanced city is not a place where the poor move about in cars, rather it's where even the rich use public transportation - Enrique Penalosa
Ah, what sights and sounds and pain lie beneath that mist. And we had thought that our hard climb out of that cruel valley led to some cool, green and peaceful, sunlit place---but it's all jungle here, a wild and savage wilderness that's overrun with ruins. But put on your crown, my Queen, and we will build a New City on these ruins. - Eldridge Cleaver, Soul on Ice
What are you thinking?â€ he asked in a disarmingly gentle tone.â€œThat the city looks different depending on whom I'm seeing it with.â€He nodded easily, as if this same thought had occurred to him. â€œI notice different things,â€ I continued. â€œLike with you, I pay more attention to the details of the buildings â€“ the textures, the colors, the people standing in front of them. The reflections are different.â€â€œReflections?â€ he asked quietly.â€œThey are.â€ I watched our bodies morph and distort in the window of an empty bank. â€œYou're there,â€ I said. â€œThat's how they're different. - Jessica Hawkins, Come Alive
He realised that in a town a man cannot live as he wishes, but as other people wish. - John Vaillant, The Tiger: A True Story of Vengeance and Survival
One is too precious about the past, the other too hungry for the future. One arm being dragged into the past by the ethics of historic preservation, the other being yanked towards a hopeful (bigger, brighter, better) future. - Winy Maas, Visionary Cities. Urgencies for the City of the Future
A city finds its life through the humans who inhabit it. When they go, what is truly left? Just silent stones, witnesses to the history but mute in its telling, remaining thus while slowly turning to rubble. It saddens me that life's moments are thus lost, that one cannot experience the past in the same rich vibrancy as the present. You live the moments and then relegate them to memory, now just two-dimensional shadows, pictures without depth, stripped of their purest emotion, their tactile connections no longer accessible. You try to recall, but can bring back only a fraction of the event lived. The rest is gone, never to be as full and complete as it was in that one place at that one time. That was what I thought as I studied these stone remains; that all the tangible things experienced here abide somewhere in time, but can never again be wholly re-animated, now just ghosts imbedded in the crumbling walls and in the fading memories of those who once lived here. - Michael  Puttonen, Disrupter
For brick and mortar breed filth and crime,With a pulse of evil that throbs and beats;And men are whithered before their primeBy the curse paved in with the lanes and streets.And lungs are poisoned and shoulders bowed, In the smothering reek of mill and mine;And death stalks in on the struggling crowdâ€”But he shuns the shadow of the oak and pine - George Washington Sears, Woodcraft and Camping
For a city to be beautiful, it must have a mysterious air! - Mehmet Murat ildan
A city full of art is a city full of wit! - Mehmet Murat ildan
The first sight of the Rapstone Valley is of something unexpectedly isolated and uninterruptedly rural -  a solitary jogger is the only outward sign of urban pollution.
Vasco bought a bottle of vodka to celebrate and they drank it in the old sailors' graveyard in Mangrove South. This was where the funeral business had first put down its roots. Over the wall, between two warehouses, Jed could just make out the Witch's Fingers, four long talons of sand that lay in the mouth of the river. Rumour had it that, on stormy nights a century ago, they used to reach out, gouge holes in passing ships, and drag them down. Hundreds of wrecks lay buried in that glistening silt. The city's black heart had beaten strongly even then. There was one funeral director, supposedly, who used to put lamps out on the Fingers and lure ships to their doom. - Rupert Thomson, The Five Gates of Hell
He was dropped under a streetlamp, the only person left on the bus. A patch of mauled light. Gritty pavement, scarred with a million cigarette burns. Weeds and spit and oil. Place like this, the only glitter was the knife just before it sank in. Place like this, there wasn't any gold. - Rupert Thomson, The Five Gates of Hell
The man slips along the stoically congealed houses Perpendicular like them A moving ornament Burning fiction His fragility contradicts the duration of his torments - HÃ©lÃ¨ne Baronne d'Oettingen, The Cubist Poets in Paris: An Anthology
You can never make a city as clean as the nature itself. To do this, you must completely demolish the city and convert it into the pure nature. - Mehmet Murat ildan
I'm in love with New York. It matches my mood. I'm not overwhelmed. It is the suitable scene for my ever ever heightened life. I love the proportions, the amplitude, the brilliance, the polish, the solidity. I look up at Radio City insolently and love it. It's all great, and Babylonian. Broadway at night. Cellophane. The newness. The vitality. True, it is only physical. But it's inspiring. Just bring your own contents, and you create a sparkle of the highest power. I'm not moved, not speechless. I stand straight, tough and I meet the impact. I feel the glow and the dancing in everything. The radio music in the taxis, scientific magic, which can all be used lyrically. That's my last word. Give New York to a poet. He can use it. It can be poetized. Or maybe that's mania of mine, to poetize. I live lightly, smoothly, actively, ears or eyes wide open, alert, oiled! I feel the glow and the dancing in every thing and the tempo is like that of my blood. I'm at once beyond, over and in New York, tasting it fully. - AnaÃ¯s Nin
In New York there is always something to look at, but it is all infinitely more interesting through a window in the backseat of a limousine. - Anna Godbersen, Bright Young Things
Chicago does not go to the world, the world comes to Chicago! Who needs New York? Who has taller buildings than our tall buildings? Who's got a busier airport than our airport? You want Picasso? We got Picasso, big Picasso. Nobody can make heads or tails of it. It's a lion? No, a seahorse. Looks to me like a radiator with wings. Who gives a damn, people, a Picasso's a Picasso. - Peter Orner, Love and Shame and Love
The City is free of sinThe snow has given it absolution A man who slips  A horse that fallsOh no, the city is in a nightgown - Pierre Albert-Birot, The Cubist Poets in Paris: An Anthology

Do you remember the long orphanage of the train stationsWe crossed cities that turn-tabled all dayAnd vomited at night the sunshine of the day ("The Voyager") - Pierre Albert-Birot, The Cubist Poets in Paris: An Anthology
The brown book I carry says there is nothing stranger than to explore a city wholly different from all those one knows, since to do so is to explore a second and unsuspected self. I have found a thing stranger: to explore such a city only after one has lived in it for some time without learning anything of it. - Gene Wolfe, The Sword of the Lictor
Every inch of space was used. As the road narrowed, signs receded upwards and changed to the vertical. Businesses simply soared from ground level and hung out vaster, more fascinatingly illuminated shingles than competitors. We were still in a traffic tangle, but now the road curved. Shops crowded the pavements and became homelier. Vegetables, spices, grocery produce in boxes or hanging from shop lintels, meats adangle - as always, my ultimate ghastliness - and here and there among the crowds the alarming spectacle of an armed Sikh, shotgun aslant, casually sitting at a bank entrance. And markets everywhere. To the right, cramped streets sloped down to the harbor. To the left, as we meandered along the tramlines through sudden dense markets of hawkers' barrows, the streets turned abruptly into flights of steps careering upwards into a bluish mist of domestic smoke, clouds of washing on poles, and climbing. Hong Kong had the knack of building where others wouldn't dare. - Jonathan Gash, Jade Woman
You know," he said, his voice making me feel cold in spite of the heat, "this city can get ahold of you and pull you back no matter how hard you try to climb out. Like a grave. - Neal Shusterman, Red Rider's Hood
This muck heaves and palpitates. It is multi-directional and has a mayor. - Donald Barthelme, City Life
But there was nothing. No village or town as far as her eyes could strain. Nowhere for her saviours to come from and take her to; just fields and trees and the weeping arc of the river Greave all the way to the horizon. Just like in the books, Greaveburn was all there was; building and building until streets were foundations, roofs were floors, constantly climbing away from itself. now that Abrasia saw it, her dream of escape crumbled completely like an ancient map in her fingers. The horizon was the world's edge and there was nothing beyond it but mist and falling.Greaveburn stood alone on this little circle of earth, the river running around and into itself like a snake eating its tail. And Abrasia was doomed to watch the sun and stars trade places for all eternity. - Craig Hallam, Greaveburn
The ride had begun.The theatre and club spectaculars seemed to stick up into the sky at all sorts of crazy angles, probably because most of them were planted diagonally on rooftops. Follow Thru, Whoopee, Show Boat, El Fay Club, Club Richman, Texas Guinan's. It gave the town the appearance of standing on its ear. ("The Number's Up") - Cornell Woolrich
With each day that our huge ship was on the ocean, my sense of being further and further away from my loved ones, my home, and my environment grew stronger. - Tilly Dunn, Exit Stage Left
When you want to change anything it is best to simply be the change. Nothing will influence your thinking and your feelings as much as your body becoming the new you.It is simple really, we are accustomed to having our minds or our emotions tell our body how to behave. Sayings like: "I expect it will be a disaster," result in slumping body language. Feelings anxiety cause our body to tense up. But you can work your system the other way around and use your body to influence your thoughts and your feelings.Try this: sit or stand up straight and put a big smile on your face - now, how do you feel? - David Ferrers M Nlp, Swap: The Brief Book That Enables Busy People to Change and Succeed

There is nothing wrong with being fascinated by the dark side of life, and ourselves, but woe to those who think this is representative of reality. All too many of us sit in our homes watching TV, falling prey to the delusion that the world is getting worse. If these sorry individuals spent more time meeting their neighbors, they'd discover that 95% of their peers are fine people. - Anthony Marais

Anna, you miss him.â€ â€œAll the time. I still can't believe he's gone.â€ The words come out in a whoosh, tasting funny in my mouth. No matter how many times I say them, they still feel like a garbled, impossible language. My chest hurts, and I have to hold my breath to keep from inhaling a deep sob. â€œHe was more than your best friend.â€ I nod absently, forgetting myself for a moment, forgetting that I'm talking to Jayne and not my journal. â€œI â€“ I mean, he was like a brother to me.

Not many Ruminarii warships had ever been captured intact by any enemy, and so for those the Ruminarii â€œinvitedâ€ aboard their vessels, this was usually a one-way sight-seeing trip. For those who really want to know, Ruminarii Hammerheads have an extensive corridor network, the interior walls are heavily decorated, savagely militaristic and inevitably, close together. He strode down one. Lesser ranks seeing him, fell to the deck and groveled like their fingernails depended on it. There was a chorus of shrieks and whimpers as he passed. When he arrived on the bridge, everyone was face down on the deck, each endeavoring to grovel lower than the next. Nothing like discipline to keep the crew in its place. - Christina Engela, Black Sunrise

I don't care who you are, we all shit the same. Beyonce shits. The pope shits. The Queen of England shits. When we shit we forget our airs and our graces, we forget how famous or how rich we are. All of that goes away. You are never more yourself than when you're taking a shit. You have that moment where you realize, 'This is me. This is who I am. - Trevor Noah, Born a Crime: Stories From a South African Childhood

Did you do this?â€â€œThere are other ways to beat someone than with fists.â€ Radu poked her in the side with a finger.She surprised him by laughing. He stood up straighter, a proud grin at having surprised and delighted Lada bursting across his face. She never laughed unless she was laughing at him. He had done something right!Then the lashings began.Radu's smile wilted and died. He looked away. He was safe now. And Lada was proud of him, which had never happened before. He focused on that to ignore the sick feelings twisting his stomach as Aron and Andrei cried out in pain. He wanted his nurseâ€”wanted her to hold and comfort himâ€”and this, too, made him feel ashamed.Lada watched the whip with a calculating look. â€œStill,â€ she said. â€œFists are faster. - Kiersten White, And I Darken
September laughed and her laugh sounded like a roar; as if she had never been able to properly laugh in her whole life, only giggle or chuckle or grin, and now that she could do it right, now that her laughing had grown up and put bells on, it had become the most boisterous, rowdy roar you ever heard. - Catherynne M. Valente, The Girl Who Fell Beneath Fairyland and Led the Revels There
You know you've reached a very sad place when the only person who can make you laugh is yourself. - Rick Yancey, The Last Star
Something wonderful has happened to me. I was carried up into the seventh heaven. There all the gods sat assembled. By special grace I was granted the favor of a wish. "Will you," said Mercury, "have youth, or beauty, or power, or a long life, or the most beautiful maiden, or any of the other glories we have in the chest? Choose, but only one thing." For a moment I was at a loss. Then I addressed myself to the gods as follows: "Most honorable contemporaries, I choose this one thing, that I may always have the laugh on my side." Not one of the gods said a word, on the contrary, they all began to laugh. Hence, I concluded that my request was granted, and found that the gods knew how to express themselves with great taste; for it would hardly have been suitable for them to answer gravely: "It is granted thee. - SÃ¸ren Kierkegaard, Either/Or: A Fragment of Life
I didn't think he'd go back for him. But it shouldn't surprise me, either, I guess . . . given their relationship. I'm extremely curious where they're hiding him, as he doesn't blend. At all. Ever. I can't imagine where they could put him that he wouldn't attract a lot of attention . . . in either form." Xev"Well, aren't we Mr. Dark and Cryptic . . . shall we call him?" Nick pulls out his phone."I doubt he knows how to work that. I'm sure he'd sniff it and eat it if you gave him one. Do you know where they're keeping him?" Xev"You know how akri-Caleb's house is up off the ground and gots all that room under it for storage?" Simi"Oh dear Gods, he's in my wine cellar? Seriously? I'm thinking I should have made amends with my brother sooner and moved him into my house to watch the puca. What kind of mutant life form do I have living in my cellar? And do I need to fumigate my house?"" Caleb - Sherrilyn Kenyon, Invision
A clown makes you laugh it doesn't mean he knows how to perform a surgery. - kambiz shabankareh, The Last Smile of The Plaster-man
She was dark-haired, fierce; she wore two drop earrings made of crystal; her face was a pure oval tickled with dimples; her skin was golden; and her laugh was like a fire in the night. But on her face you could also read the concentration of a soul whose life is entirely inward, and a mischievous gravity which acquires a silver patina with age. - Muriel Barbery, The Life of Elves
I finally made eye contact with the boy in the bed. He lay on his side, a tube in his nose and another in his vein. His cheeks were sunken, and his skin was ghostly pale. His hair might have been blond, but it was fading into a gray, making it hard to tell. The only part of this boy that held any life at all were his eyes, which brimmed with tears when he saw me.â€œKahlen?â€I sat still. These three people all called me by the same name, which sounded sort of like Katlyn and Ellen and made me believe that maybe they actually knew me.â€œWhere did you go? Where have you been? I thought you were dead.â€ His chest worked overtime, trying to keep up with his mouth, spilling over with words.â€œCan you get her a pen? Please?â€ He lifted an arm weakly. It was all bone. â€œI just need to know.â€â€œA pen?â€ I asked.Once again his eyes lit up.â€œYou can talk?â€I stared at this boy, at how he was overjoyed at one of the most basic things a person could do. â€œSo it would seem.â€ I smiled.He flopped onto his back, laughing from his gut, and based on Julie's tears, I was guessing she'd been waiting a long time for that to come back. - Kiera Cass, The Siren

You clumsy wenchâ€”Gods above! Are you trying to rob me, girl?â€ The nobleman seizes my wrist and yanks it from his pocket. My hand comes up with the pipe clenched in it. I stare at him, horrified.â€œI . . .â€â€œI'll have your head for this!â€ the man rages. â€œI'll have you whipped!â€***â€œI got the pipe,â€ I say, holding it up.He stares for a minute, blinking, and then bursts into laughter. A few curious deer stick their heads through the shrubs to see what the racket is. Aladdin doubles over, laughing loud enough to startle birds from the trees overhead, and after a moment, I start laughing too.

We sit on the grass and laugh until our faces are red and we're out of breath.â€œYou are the worst thief I have ever seen,â€ declares Aladdin.â€œI don't know what you're talking about. I got it, didn't I?â€â€œMy grandmother could pick pockets better than that! Though that's not quite fair; my grandmother was the best pickpocket in Parthenia. She taught me all her tricks.

This two quotes make me laugh"Andre Linoge: Born in lust, turn to dust. Born in sin, COME ON IN." (Stephen King on Storm of the Century)"We are on location, not on vacation"(Unnatural 2015 Film)Everyday when I read it or I repeat it makes me laugh it's kind a joke. The first one is a killer joke, the second one is...(you guess from who is this joke!) - Deyth Banger
When I watch a movie or read a book, be it a melodrama or horror, I always hate the female character... Well, most of the time I do.Why? Because she is always dumb.I shit you not.For example in this one chick-flick movie, "Serendipity", Sara tells that Jonathan guy that she won't give him her number because if they are meant to meet again, they will. Seriously? Romantic movie my ass, there's not anything romantic in letting go of someone when you can grab them with both of your hands. That is not romantic, THAT is stupid.In another movie the girl storms out, never hearing the guy out, just like in that one book I've been reading recently, "Tangled". Now this is an issue with most of the books and chick-flicks. Like why? Why won't you stop a minute, take a deep breath, count to ten and listen to the guy. Only after that, for God's sake, say â€˜fuck you' then â€˜Namaste' and then walk away while swaying your hips like there is no tomorrow? Let them know what they will be missing for the rest of their lives.In some other movies I hate the main female character because of the scriptwriters. The girl somehow always appears in front of the guy out of nowhere. Like he can be walking down the street and then boom! ABRACADABRA! The main girl bumps into him in NYC out of all places. They make it seem like whatever they do their steps always bring them back to each other. Dumb, I know. - Melanie Sargsian, Lovember: A Collection of Short Love Stories

She yanked her hand away as if he had burned her, rubbing her palm along her thigh. The feeling didn't go away, and neither did the butterflies he had sent winging in her stomach. â€œHow do you know you're not a vampire?â€ She needed to distract him, distract both of them. â€œMaybe you forgot. You're certainly capable of acting like one.â€ This time he laughed, startling both of them. The sound was husky, low, and foreign to his ears, as if he had forgotten what it was like. His black eyes leapt to her face almost in fear. â€œNot bad, wild man. First a growl, and now a laugh. We're making progress.â€ Her eyes danced at him, reassured him. - Christine Feehan, Dark Desire
Laugh as much as possible. Because this makes your life better! - Deyth Banger

When I was young, I forgot how to laugh in the cave of Trophonius; when I was older, I opened my eyes and beheld reality, at which I began to laugh, and since then, I have not stopped laughing. I saw that the meaning of life was to secure a livelihood, and that its goal was to attain a high position; that love's rich dream was marriage with an heiress; that friendship's blessing was help in financial difficulties; that wisdom was what the majority assumed it to be; that enthusiasm consisted in making a speech; that it was courage to risk the loss of ten dollars; that kindness consisted in saying, â€œYou are welcome,â€ at the dinner table; that piety consisted in going to communion once a year. This I saw, and I laughed. - SÃ¸ren Kierkegaard

We seem to live in a world where you have to walk around grinning like a loon. I can't understand all the fuss about Mona Lisa painting, everyone wondering why she's not smiling, if she's depressed or heartbroken. No, she was just normal!Emotions are always extreme these days: you either have to be crying with laughter or crying in pain. No wonder water levels are rising. It's not global warming, it's all the tears from crying. - Karl Pilkington
I break out laughing. I frown.I yell and scream. Sometimes,if one jokes and giggles,one causes war.So I hide how tickled I am.Tears well up in my eyes.My body is a large city.Much grieving in one sector.I live in another part.Lakewater.Something on fire over here.I am sour when you are sour,sweet when you are sweet.You are my face and my back.Only through you can I knowthis back-scratching pleasure.Now people the likes of you and Icome clapping, inventing dances,climbing into this high meadow.I am a spoiled parrot who eats only candy.I have no interest in bitter food.Some have been given harsh knowledge. Not I.Some are lame and jerking along.I am smooth and glidingly quick.Their road is full of washed-out placesand long inclines. Mine isroyally level, effortless.The huge Jerusalem mosque stands inside me,and women full of light.Laughter leaps out.It is the nature of the rose to laugh.It cannot help but laugh. - Jalaluddin Rumi, Bridge to the Soul: Journeys Into the Music and Silence of the Heart

Actually, Elizabeth realized, when he laughed like that, he did look quite handsome. His dark brown hair and his eyes, so light a brown as to seem almost gold in color, were not quite as nondescript as she'd once thought. Maybe the giggling young ingenues weren't completely daft. Despite his maddening tendencies to be deliberately obtuse and tease her relentlessly, he had a certain charisma. - Emma Wildes, Our Wicked Mistake

Xav sprinkled olive oil on his lettuce. 'Lola was very particular that it all had to fit properly.' 'Lola?' squeaked Diamond. I wanted to warn her not to rise to the bait Xav was dangling in front of her but it was too late. Xav added some Parmesan and pepper. 'Suspicious, Diamond? You should be. This is a bachelor party I'm organizing, not a school outing, and it is going to tick all of Trace's boxes. Lola is either a very efficient water sports instructor or an exotic dancing girl; I'll leave it your imagination.' I rolled my eyes at Diamond. 'Myabe she's both.

Always say â€œyesâ€ to the present moment. What could be more futile, more insane, than to create inner resistance to what already is? what could be more insane than to oppose life itself, which is now and always now? Surrender to what is. Say â€œyesâ€ to life â€” and see how life suddenly starts working for you rather than against you. - Eckhart Tolle

Feeling the slight tremor of his fingers against her skin, Daisy was emboldened to remark, â€œI've never been attracted to tall men before. But you make me feelâ€”â€ â€œIf you don't keep quiet,â€ he interrupted curtly, â€œI'm going to strangle you.â€ Daisy felt silent, listening to the rhythm of his breath as it turned deeper, less controlled. By contrast his fingers became more certain in their task, working along the row of pearls until her dress gaped open and the sleeves slipped from her shoulders. â€œWhere is it?â€ he asked. â€œThe key?â€His tone was deadly. â€œYes, Daisy. The key.â€ â€œIt fell inside my corset. Which meansâ€¦ I'll have to take that off too.â€ There was no reaction to the statement, no sound or movement. Daisy twisted to glance at Matthew. He seemed dazed. His eyes looked unnaturally blue against the flush on his face. She realized he was occupied with a savage inner battle to keep from touching her. Feeling hot and prickly with embarrassment, Daisy pulled her arms completely out of her sleeves. She worked the dress over her hips, wriggling out of the filmy white layers, letting them slide to the floor in a heap. Matthew stared at the discarded dress as if it were some kind of exotic fauna he had never seen before. Slowly his eyes returned to Daisy, and an incoherent protest came from his throat as she began to unhook her corset. She felt shy and wicked, undressing in front of him. But she was encouraged by the way he seemed unable to tear his gaze from each newly revealed inch of pale skin. When the last metal hook came apart, she tossed the web of lace and stays to the floor. All that remained over her breasts was a crumpled chemise. The key had dropped into her lap. Closing her fingers around the metal object, she risked a cautious glance at Matthew. His eyes were closed, his forehead scored with furrows of pained concentration. â€œThis isn't going to happen,â€ he said, more to himself than to her. Daisy leaned forward to tuck the key into his coat pocket. Gripping the hem of her chemise, she stripped it over her head. A tingling shock chased over her naked upper body. She was so nervous that her teeth had begun to chatter. â€œI just took my chemise off,â€ she said. â€œDon't you want to look?â€ â€œNo.â€ But his eyes had opened, and his gaze found her small, pink-tipped breasts, and the breath hissed through his clenched teeth. He sat without moving, staring at her as she untied his cravat and unbuttoned the layers of his waistcoat and shirt. She blushed everywhere but continued doggedly, rising to her knees to tug the coat from his shoulders. He moved like a dreamer, slowly pulling his arms from the coat sleeves and waistcoat. Daisy pushed his shirt open with awkward determination, her gaze drinking in the sight of his chest and torso. His skin gleamed like heavy satin, stretched taut over broad expanses of muscle. She touched the powerful vault of his ribs, trailing her fingertips to the rippled tautness of his midriff. Suddenly Matthew caught her hand, seemingly undecided whether to push it away or press it closer. Her fingers curled over his. She stared into his dilated blue eyes. â€œMatthew,â€ she whispered. â€œI'm here. I'm yours. I want to do everything you've ever imagined doing with me.â€ He stopped breathing. His will foundered and collapsed, and suddenly nothing mattered except the demands of a desire that had been denied too long. With a rough groan of surrender, he lifted her onto his lap. - Lisa Kleypas, Scandal in Spring

Surrender is acknowledging that we need Divine Intervention; we don't know it all, we do not see what God sees.When we give ourselves the first 15 minutes of the first hour of the day, to pray, meditate, read, journal, reflect, silently inquire after God, we set the tone for clear thinking throughout our day. - SHANNON TANNER - Shannon Tanner, Worthy: The POWER of Wholeness

We should not shed tears.That is a surrender of the body to the heart.It is only proofThat we are beings that do not knowWhat to do with our hearts - Tite Kubo, Bleach, Volume 07
We think it's weak to surrender, but sometimes it's the bravest thing we can possibly do. - Toni Sorenson
It is also good to love: because love is difficult. For one human being to love another human being: that is perhaps the most difficult task that has been entrusted to us, the ultimate task, the final test and proof, the work for which all other work is merely preparation.... Loving does not at first mean merging, surrendering, and uniting with another person (for what would a union be of two people who are unclarified, unfinished, and still incoherent?), it is a high inducement for the individual to ripen, to become something in himself, to become world, to become world in himself for the sake of another person; it is a great, demanding claim on him, something that chooses him and calls him to vast distances... Merging and surrendering and every kind of communion is not for them (who must still, for a long, long time, save and gather themselves); it is the ultimate, is perhaps that for which human lives are as yet barely large enough. - Rainer Maria Rilke, Letters to a Young Poet
Fear of death is fear of surrender to Infinity. Learn to surrender, to exist at Infinity while alive, and fear of death dissolves. Fear of death is fear of the Unknown. Realize the Wonder, the Eternal Unknowability of the Totality of Existence, and fear of death is transcended. If happiness or freedom depends on the Answer to the Question, then there can be no happiness or freedom. The Question cannot be satisfactorily or finally Answered. For one who abides at Infinity, happy and free, at ease with his Ultimate Ignorance, the Question and the Answer are equally unnecessary. What began will come to an end. What is Wonderful is not threatened. The Process of the Totality of Existence is Transcendental and Eternal. Only a fraction of the Whole can pass away in any moment, since only a fraction of the Whole appears in any moment. Therefore, the Heart Itself is always already Full of Wonder and Love. "I" is the body-mind, the fraction of the Whole that is now appearing and will soon disappear. "I" must be surrendered to the Heart, to the Whole, which is Infinity, Wonder, and Love. - Adi Da Samraj, The Eating Gorilla Comes in Peace: The Transcendental Principle of Life Applied to Diet and the Regenerative Discipline of True Health
It is generally the trustful and optimistic people who can afford to retreat. The loveless and faithless ones are compelled by their pessimism to attack. - T.H. White, The Ill-Made Knight
...there was a certain comfort in surrender. - Adam Langer, The Salinger Contract
A surrendered day is a good day. - Danielle Boonstra
Their raspy kisses brand our jam tart necks, their treacherous miasma clasps our herbal thighs. Motherlessly we surrender, too many fathers we have, we, your daughters of joy. - Laura Gentile, Seraphic Addiction
Have this faith that someone is there to take away your weaknesses. Ok, you slipped once, twice, thrice. It does not matter. Keep moving ahead. People take vows never to commit mistakes again. Breaking the vows makes it worse. Surrendering is better - Sri Sri Ravi Shankar
Every person has a season for knowledge. - Elana Johnson, Surrender
We're all broken. We all have cracks. It's not about making it through life in one piece it's about narrowing the gap between the fissures so we don't shatter.â€Ted Basel to Jo Nehr in my next "Surrender" story - Riley  Murphy
I love you, I've loved you for years and I'll love you for years more. It's not something I can fight, it's not something I want to fight. - Somi Ekhasomhi, Always Yours
DADDYYou do not do, you do not doAny more, black shoeIn which I have lived like a footFor thirty years, poor and white,Barely daring to breathe or Achoo.Daddy, I have had to kill you.You died before I had timeâ€•Marble-heavy, a bag full of God,Ghastly statue with one grey toeBig as a Frisco sealAnd a head in the freakish AtlanticWhen it pours bean green over blueIn the waters of beautiful Nauset.I used to pray to recover you.Ach, du.In the German tongue, in the Polish townScraped flat by the rollerOf wars, wars, wars.But the name of the town is common.My Polack friendSays there are a dozen or two.So I never could tell where youPut your foot, your root,I never could talk to you.The tongue stuck in my jaw.It stuck in a barb wire snare.Ich, ich, ich, ich,I could hardly speak.I thought every German was you.And the language obsceneAn engine, an engineChuffing me off like a Jew.A Jew to Dachau, Auschwitz, Belsen.I began to talk like a Jew.I think I may well be a Jew.The snows of the Tyrol, the clear beer of ViennaAre not very pure or true.With my gypsy ancestress and my weird luckAnd my Taroc pack and my Taroc packI may be a bit of a Jew.I have always been scared of you,With your Luftwaffe, your gobbledygoo.And your neat mustacheAnd your Aryan eye, bright blue.Panzer-man, panzer-man, O Youâ€•Not God but a swastikaSo black no sky could squeak through.Every woman adores a Fascist,The boot in the face, the bruteBrute heart of a brute like you.You stand at the blackboard, daddy,In the picture I have of you,A cleft in your chin instead of your footBut no less a devil for that, no notAnd less the black man whoBit my pretty red heart in two.I was ten when they buried you.At twenty I tried to dieAnd get back, back, back to you.I thought even the bones would do.But they pulled me out of the sack,And they stuck me together with glue.And then I knew what to do.I made a model of you,A man in black with a Meinkampf lookAnd a love of the rack and the screw.And I said I do, I do.So daddy, I'm finally through.The black telephone's off at the root,The voices just can't worm through.If I've killed one man, I've killed twoâ€•The vampire who said he was youAnd drank my blood for a year,Seven years, if you want to know.Daddy, you can lie back now.There's a stake in your fat black heartAnd the villagers never like you.They are dancing and stamping on you.They always knew it was you.Daddy, daddy, you bastard, I'm through. - Sylvia Plath, Ariel
But what humans forget, cells remember. The body, that elephant - Jeffrey Eugenides
Don't use a five-dollar word when a fifty-cent word will do. - Mark Twain
Work on good prose has three steps: a musical stage when it is composed, an architectonic one when it is built, and a textile one when it is woven. - Walter Benjamin
A changeableness, too, as if beneath my visible face there was another, having second thoughts. - Jeffrey Eugenides, Middlesex
He turns and walks away, moving so quickly that the candle flames shiver with the motion of the air. â€œI miss you,â€ Isobel says as he leaves, but the sentiment is crushed by the clatter of the beaded curtain falling closed behind him. - Erin Morgenstern, The Night Circus
Juliet!' I whip around but not quickly enough. She's swallowed by the crowd, the gap that allowed her to break for the door closing just as quickly as it opened, a shifting Tetris pattern of bodies... - Lauren Oliver, Before I Fall
A good sentence in prose should be like a good line in poetry, unchangeable, as rhythmic, as sonorous. - Gustave Flaubert, Selected Letters
Rain woke him, a slow drizzle, his feet tangled in coils of discarded fiberoptics. The arcade's sea of sound washed over him, receded, returned. Rolling over, he sat up and held his head. - William Gibson, Neuromancer
The displacement of water is equal to the something of something. - William Faulkner
The scrape and snap of Keds on loose alley pebbles seems to catapult their voices high into the moist March air blue above the wires. - John Updike
Raz was one of those vanguard human beings of indeterminate ethnicity, the magnificent mutts that I hope we are all destined to become given another millennium of intermixing. His skin was a rich pecan color from his dad, who was part African American and part native Hawaiian. His hair, straight and glossy black, and the almond shape of his eyes came from his Japanese grandmother. But their color was the cool blue he'd inherited from his mum, a Swedish windsurfing champion. - Geraldine Brooks, People of the Book
As his dark closet shows, Bluebeard was a collector at heart, and even after dispatching a wife, could not let her fully depart. - Shuli Barzilai, Tales of Bluebeard and His Wives from Late Antiquity to Postmodern Times
Feel no regret for roses, autumn too has its delights...How could she say that? Didn't she see that for us there could never be autumn, that we could never sit, as anyone else could sit, beside the fire all day on Sundays in November; that September's leaves, that fall for man and beast alike, were not our leaves to walk in; that October storms would never find us sharing an umbrella? The love of spring had thrived on wine and candles; now in the August of our lives, we needed newspapers and comfortable chairs. But it was impossible. No autumn--only a cold wind that blew through our summer, freezing the leaves in their places before they could motley and fall. - Raphael Carter, The Fortunate Fall
Prose lies its way to the truth - Bert McCoy
Closer, it's all right. Touch the man of grief.Do. Don't be afraid. My troubles are mine and I am the only man alive who can sustain them. - Sophocles, Oedipus Rex
As she gobbled up the miles, big ravines appeared before her, their starving mouths open for the swallow. - R.J.  Lawrence, The Xactilias Project
Iverson glanced down at my white-knuckled grip, then at my eyes. A hint of a smile more subtle than a single flick of snow crossed his face, and his eyes nodded approval. - Allen Eskins
Oyin Da's mind is as elegant as a French horn, thoughts moving in whorls and evoking fresh mint leaves. - Tade Thompson, Rosewater
I have learned that love is often strongest where it is most threatened. Where it is most terrorised is where it most profusely grows.Lillian WhiteI Would Send You Poppies - Lillian White
Coyote Mountain too much for her, alone with pine trees up to your neck, wooden bench by the Pecos River which runssilver in the winter untold. Dust-bit dirt lonely Indians with wet brown bellies which the moon shines upon like a frosty lake, the silver show of market stalls and paintings of four pitiful horses likes of which the Spanish brought under the Mexican memory of nightfall but the oldMing china-woman on her rickety bicycle with broken straw hat with bow-legged strength,simply; the perfect depiction of the fellaheen world riddled with ancient endeavour, the old china women of the world you'll find them so perfect in all your cities under the twinkle of stars. Thewould be fishermen of dawn, collected wintery downpours and sunlight situations which never beckon further than his share, meant on this earth , match stick motels which warp your loving tales of good mornings or whichever is left. - Samuel J Dixey, An evening in Autumn: The unbegotten procession
And just as he had tried, on the southern beach, to find again that unique rounded black pebble with the regular little white belt, which she had happened to show him on the eve of their last ramble, so now he did his best to look up all the roadside items that retained her exclamation mark: the special profile of a cliff, a hut roofed with a layer of silvery-gray scales, a black fir tree and a footbridge over a white torrent, and something which one might be inclined to regard as a kind of fatidic prefiguration: the radial span of a spider's web between two telegraph wires that were beaded with droplets of mist. She accompanied him: her little boots stepped rapidly, and her hands never stopped moving, movingâ€”to pluck a leaf from a bush or stroke a rock wall in passingâ€”light, laughing hands that knew no repose. He saw her small face with its dense dark freckles, and her wide eyes, whose pale greenish hue was that of the shards of glass licked smooth by the sea waves. - Vladimir Nabokov, The Return of Chorb
How might you measure men beneath our skies? The shear depth of the human heart and her capacity for humbleness?Like a scientific fraction huh, but I am born of these times so forgive me that. Under this grey skied dream which has already been, already dreamt. Already past? Might everything be just hindsight? Already known gone faded the sun too, so nothing like that to be worried about? AndEngland when did she fall or might she never have begun? Withered earth before the withered Sun? Your forever field will forever be in my heart; alas here I am bold content and never knowing. - Samuel J Dixey, An evening in Autumn: The unbegotten procession
There will come a time in life, when you have to take decisions from your own. Choose wisely.As whatever you choose, will require your â€œcomplete timeâ€ & â€œattentionâ€.So you must need to trust yourself,whenever you have to make a life's decision. - Ayushi Jain
The itchy reality of these places is that they are no place at all, they are nowhere. There's a sleeping monster in nowhere, and it is older and bigger than you, it is island-sized, and it has never known happiness. If you're ever nowhere at all, and you do think about it, and you can hardly think about anything else, and you can hardly breathe, and oh, God, it is awake, it is that grand realisation which nobody can speak. Don't speak it! What would you say?But all is not lost, because in our language we have this phrase. We never have to be nowhere at all, we only ever have to be in the middle of nowhere, which is a softer, funnier place to be. Do you see? The phrase makes nowhere a place, with boundaries and a centre, and if there are boundaries then you can leave this place, you can travel in any direction and â€œnowhereâ€ will cease to be, and this whole experience will be something you can laugh about. - Quintin Smith
By degrees, the bitterness at my heart diffused itself to the circumference of the circle in which my life went its cheerless mechanical round. - Edward Bulwer-Lytton, A Strange Story
He lifted his arm that had been resting on her shoulders and gazed at the words she had written on his hand. He had been branded as cattle are branded to show whom they belong to. The cold mountain air stung his lips. She was driving too fast on this road that had once been a forest. Early humans had lived in it. They studied fire and the movement of the sun. They read the clouds and the moon and tried to understand the human mind His father had tried to melt him into a Polish forest when he was five years old. He knew he must leave no trace or trail of his existence because he must never find his way home. That was what his father had told him. You cannot come home. This was not something possible to know but he had to know it all the same - Deborah Levy, Swimming Home
You'd love a bit of pomp: that way in later years you might invoke end-of-empire ghosts. - China MiÃ©ville, Embassytown
Rock rock. Back and forth. Lull. Push. Release. Swing back. The stars, the leaves, even the sound of the creek throbbing back and forth. Of a boat. Of a hammock. Of a child's swing. Of a womb. Back and forth. Rock rock. Smell of cold current, of stone, manure, blossom. Sleep. - Peter Heller, The Dog Stars
There's a big default notion that â€œspare,â€ or â€œpreciseâ€ prose is somehow better. I keep insisting to them that while such prose is completely legitimate, it's in no way intrinsically more accurate, more relevant, or better than lush prose. That adjective â€œprecise,â€ for example, needs unpicking. If a â€œminimalistâ€ writer describes a table, and a metaphor-ridden adjective-heavy weird fictioneer describes a table, they are very different, but the former is in absolutely no way closer to the material reality than the latter. Both of them are radically different from that reality. They're just words. A table is a big wooden thing with my tea on it. - China MiÃ©ville
In general, dividing literature into prose and poetry began with the appearance of prose, for only in prose could such a division be expressed. By its nature, by its essence, art is hierarchical, automatically, and in this hierarchy, poetry stands above prose. If only because poetry is older. Poetry really is a very strange thing, because it belongs to a troglodyte as well as to a snob. It can be produced in the Stone Age and in the most modern salon, whereas prose requires a developed society, a developed structure, certain established classes, if you like. Here you could start reasoning like a Marxist without even being wrong. The poet works from the voice, from the sound. For him, content is not as important as is ordinarily believed. For a poet, there is almost no difference between phonetics and semantics. Therefore, only very rarely does the poet give any thought to who in fact comprises his audience. That is, he does so much more rarely than the prose writer. - Joseph Brodsky
She stopped then and turned her face toward him and the hateful wind. - Toni Morrison
Bottom line, when someone defensively says their way of writing is their style, then that usually means they're making an excuse for poor prose. - A.J. Flowers, A Guide to Writing Your First Novel
Gennia is eating and talking to Ruiz on the phone. Each time he takes a mouthful, he catches a whiff of his shirt, which stinks of failure and yesterday. - Michael Robotham, Watching You
It ain't so easy writing about nothin - Patti Smith, M Train
Flora took pleasure in the delicacy of her approach and studied the ways of the smallest, sweetest blooms she could find, tiny pimpernels and forget-me-nots hiding in the pockets of the fields. The energy of the sun on her body and the joy of foraging filled her soul. She flew the fields and gathered until the light began to fade and she heard the sound of her forager sisters' wings turning for home. Then she joined them. - Laline Paull, The Bees
Speak without words. Know the weight of words - SpillingInk
Mirabelle sat down, dropping into the cushions like a ball being caught in a large leather glove.â€¨ - Sara Sheridan, British Bulldog
Victor was the first to speak, and when he did, it was with an eloquence and composure perfectly befitting the situation - V.E. Schwab
As Raimbaut dragged a dead man along he thought, â€˜Ohcorpse, I have come rushing here only to be dragged along by theheels like you. What is this frenzy that drives me, this mania forbattle and for love, when seen from the place where your staringeyes gaze and your flung-back head knocks over stones? It's thatI think of, oh corpse, it's that you make me think of: but does anythingchange? Nothing. No other days exist but these of oursbefore the tomb, both for us the living and for you the dead. Mayit be granted me not to waste them, not to waste anything of whatI am, of what I could be: to do deeds helpful to the Frankish cause:to embrace, to be embraced by, proud Bradamante. I hope youspent your days no worse, oh corpse. Anyway to you the dice have already shown their numbers. For me they are still whirling in thebox. And I love my own disquiet, corpse, not your peace. - Italo Calvino
What did Saturday's used to taste like? Like eggs and fried ham and the bitter smell of hair in heavy rollers. Like long quiet hours and making up after a fight. Like ointment and bruising. Like waiting, especially, for something - anything - to happen. - Lauren Oliver
The joyous clamor in my mind drowned out the strange sound outside the car: a humming noise that was gathering speed and growing louder, a roar that was not the waves curling up the beach. - Padma Venkatraman, Climbing the Stairs
Their lives have a size and a shape now. Estha has his and Rahel hers.Edges, Borders, Boundaries, Brinks and Limits have appeared like a team of trolls on their separate horizons. Short creatures with long shadows, patrolling the Blurry End. Gentle half-moons have gathered under their eyes and they are as old as Ammu was when she died. Thirty-one. Not old.Not young.But a viable die-able age. - Arundhati Roy, The God of Small Things
There were these things and the flames ate these things, and since fire doesn't distinguish between the word of God and the word of the Soviet Communications Registry Bureau, both Qur'an and telephone directory returned to His mouth in the same inhalation of smoke. - Anthony Marra, A Constellation of Vital Phenomena
You never turn away family, no matter how f***ed up they are. - Ronald Velesovsky
Despite my affection for subtext and plot and prose at its best... life, it turns out, is nothing more than the finer details. - Bailey Vincent, The Details of How We Lived
Once he got bitten, and they all wept bitterly, expecting to see a spectacular death-agony; but he just went off into the bush and probably ate something, for he came back in a few days quite cock-a-hoop and as ready to eat snakes as ever. - Richard Hughes
A forced contemplation of the heavens, crisp and angelic blue, a classic prelude to death. - Rachel Kushner, The Flamethrowers
Insofar as craft and poetics in a poem have a politics, I wanted to avoid that brittle enjambed-prose-sentence-lyric verse, where you have standard sentences snapped off and scattered decoratively across the page (which I might go out on a limb and say was characteristic of some leftist poets, Beat poets, street poets and populist poets of the 70s and 80sâ€”all of whom I basically view as comrades, I should probably say, to this day) and on the other hand I also wanted my poetics to operate differently than those more right-wing academicsâ€”in practiceâ€”even if in their poems or statements they proclaim public leftist views or ideasâ€”they remain academic poets, operating in elite university-supported circles, institutionalized and reading before institutional audiences, awarding grants and awards to each other, sitting on each other's grants panels, awards and tenure committees, as Philip Levine admitted in an interview in Don't Ask, 'giving prizes to friends. - Sesshu Foster
Because even when there is no hope, somehow you can still find a place to pin inside the things that you need. - Chris   Howard, Rootless
In general, I would think that at present prose writers are much in advance of the poets. In the old days, I read more poetry than prose, but now it is in prose where you find things being put together well, where there is great ambition, and equal talent. Poets have gotten so careless, it is a disgrace. You can't pick up a page. All the words slide off. - William H. Gass
And I howled at that swarm and the crops and the sky, and the stars should have quit because there weren't no reason to be shining. - Chris   Howard
why be bothered with other people's set-ups? it only leads to torture. - Bob Dylan
I felt naked beneath the wildness of her eyes. I felt alive. Unknown. And I knew then that the world contained so many things I would never understand. - Chris   Howard, Rootless
I wouldn't give ten gallons of my own piss for clear sentence that gives the sense of a tree as a tree, when I revel in the nonsense of its being my own Grandfather, a letter from yesterday, or a masturbating fist. - David Joseph Cribbin, Father Crow and Other Poems
Most people become bankrupt through having invested too heavily in the prose of life. To have ruined one's self over poetry is an honour. - Oscar Wilde, The Picture of Dorian Gray
You couldn't make up something that looked so right. - Chris   Howard, Rootless
You take what you can get, I reckon. You take what you can get. - Chris   Howard, Rootless
The flesh of prose gets its shape and strength from the bones of grammar. - Constance Hale
I'm a man of music as much as I am a man of words and prose. One could even possibly say that they, music and prose, are connected to a lengthy and mutually beneficial extent and that they have been of centuries or millenniums. - Nicholas Trandahl
Tell all the truth but tell it slant. - Emily Dickinson, The Complete Poems of Emily Dickinson
I can't be expected to produce deathless prose in an atmosphere of gloom and eucalyptus. - Gerald Durrell, My Family and Other Animals
The fact is that certain themes cannot be celebrated in words, and tyranny is one of them. No one ever wrote a good book in praise of the Inquisition. - George Orwell, Books v. Cigarettes
Unlike Gatsby and Tom Buchanan I had no girl whose disembodied face floated along the dark cornices and blinding signs and so I drew up the girl beside me, tightening my arms. Her wan scornful mouth smiled and I drew her up again, closer, this time to my face. - F. Scott Fitzgerald, The Great Gatsby
He was a compact, clearcut man, with precise features, a lot of very soft black hair, and thoughtful dark brown eyes. He had a look of wariness, which could change when he felt relaxed or happy, which was not often in these difficult days, into a smile of amused friendliness and pleasure which aroused feelings of warmth, and something more, in many women. - A.S. Byatt, Possession
I knew it was a day of endings, one way or another. - Chris   Howard, Rootless
Later when they would mention, they would say, and everyone would know, but not nearly as well as they meant. - Mikl Paul, Dandelions That have Held your Breath
The punter sweated on top of Marina, his lips all over her young body, his tongue slipping out from rows of crooked teeth, pushing hungrily from between his shrivelled lips like a clam from a shell, a bottom feeder searching for salty nutrition. - Tom Conrad
In strict medical terms marijuana is far safer than many foods we commonly consume. For example, eating 10 raw potatoes can result in a toxic response. By comparison, it is physically impossible to eat enough marijuana to induce death. Marijuana in its natural form is one of the safest therapeutically active substances known to man. By any measure of rational analysis marijuana can be safely used within the supervised routine of medical care.[DEA Administrative Law Judge - 1988] - Francis Young
Valek coalesced from the shadows and wrapped me in his long lean arms. I soaked in his musky smell, listening to his heart beat. Strong and steady. No indication that he had been sneaking around. - Maria V. Snyder, Ice Study
Getting to the top is optional. Getting down is mandatory. - Ed Viesturs, No Shortcuts to the Top: Climbing the World's 14 Highest Peaks
I had come to discover that "safe" was an illusion, a pretense that adults wrapped around their children- and sometimes themselves- to make the world seem comfortable. I had discovered that under that thin cover of let's-pretend, monsters and nightmares lay, and that not all of them came from places like the moonroads or the nightling cities. Some of the monsters were people we knew. People we thought we could trust. - Holly Lisle, The Silver Door
A woman who goes around wearing a knife is obviously looking for trouble." She reached deep into her pocket and brought out a long, slender piece of metal, glittering all along one edge. "However a woman who carries a knife is ready for trouble. Generally speaking, it's easier to appear harmless. It's less trouble all around. - Patrick Rothfuss, The Name of the Wind
It was the kind of terrified look that reminds you that no matter how rational or grown up a person might seem, some part of him is absolutely sure - knows - that an evil other-world exists just outside of our regular, everyday world. And that although we don't expect that world to collide with our calm, predictable one...well, really, at any moment that is exactly what might happen. - Ann M. Martin, A Corner of the Universe
Up in the distance the whistle of the wind sang to her from the mountain. From Lucian's mountain. It beckoned and taunted and she wanted to run towards it. To be enveloped in its coat of fleece and to hear its safe sounds. - Melina Marchetta, Quintana of Charyn
Actually, [Wax] said, we came here because we needed someplace safe to think for a few hours."Ranette: "Your mansion isn't safe?"Wax: "My butler failed to poison me, then tried to shoot me, then set off an explosive in my study"Ranette: "Huh....

Safety tip. When you see smoke run, never wait for fire. - Danielle Sibarium, For Always
Stay the night, said the officer, patting a confiscated couch. I'll keep my hands off you. I promise.You have more than hands, said Elie.My feet are safe, too, said the officer. He pointed to a hole in his boots, and they laughed. - Thaisa Frank, Heidegger's Glasses
Taking Mum's hand, I whispered "Are we really safe, here? - Alwyn Evans, Walk in My Shoes
When what we believe we've mastered is no longer predictable we're not fine. The world suddenly is a very scary place. It loses its charm. - Patricia Cornwell, Dust
How strange it (the earthquake) must all have seemed to them, here where they lived so safely always! They thought such a dreadful thing could happen to others, but not to them. That is the way! - William Dean Howells, A Sleep and a Forgetting
Risk is the increased consequence of failure. - Michael Bane, Trail Safe: Averting Threatening Human Behavior in the Outdoors
I delve into the mysterious and counterintuitive world of helmets and high-visibility gear later in the book. But it's worth immediately noting this: while they're not inherently bad, they're less a safety device for cycling than a symptom of a road network where no cyclist can truly feel safe. - Peter Walker, How Cycling Can Save the World
The most basic bit of advice given to women who have to walk alone at night is, â€˜Look alert. Be aware of your surroundings and walk briskly. You will be safer if you know where you are going, and if anyone who observes you senses that.' The stalking, predatory animal cuts the weakest from the pack, and then kills at his leisure. - Ann Rule, The Stranger Beside Me: Ted Bundy The Shocking Inside Story
My own fault. The equipment had safeties but your primary piece of protective equipment was your brain. There was a presumption that anyone entering this room was intelligent enough to keep away from hot things, sharp things, and things carrying large stores of momentum. - Max Barry, Machine Man

Take this machine out of service immediately until you've got the proper â€˜R' clip! â€¦.. Put your glasses on â€¦. Where's the edge protection. Who removed the edge protection? Right, let me phone for a scaffolder â€¦.. Put your glasses on â€¦.. Oi! Get out from under there! Never, ever stand underneath a suspended load. Even if all the equipment's been inspected, which it obviously has, you can never trust the crane driver. He can be taken ill suddenly â€¦.. Come here, mate, let's have a little chat. Why are you working on Fall Arrest? You're supposed to be working on Fall Restraint (FR â€˜restrains' you going near the perimeter edge of the building, FA â€˜arrests' your fall if, well, if you fall. If you're hanging off a building we've got less than ten minutes to reach you before you start going into toxic shock brought on by suspension trauma. In other words, we need a Rescue Plan, which is why we'd prefer people work on Fall Restraint) - Karl Wiggins, Dogshit Saved My Life
Safety is an illusion and perhaps it's better to challenge it sometimes, to see how far we can go, to learn about the stuff we are made of. - Tania Aebi, I've Been Around
Even if it means I'll never be the man you give yourself to, I'll always do anything to protect you. - Parker S. Huntington, Asher Black
Our â€œprotective bubblesâ€â€”our houses, our cars, our friends, our online identitiesâ€”might make us feel secure, but most of it's just an illusion. It's easy to get hurt, just like it's easy to hurt other people. - Paula Stokes, This is How it Happened
If either one of you is ever in a situation you're not entirely comfortable withâ€”call me. I don't care what time it is. I don't care who is there or what is going on. You call me and I will come get you. - Mindy McGinnis, The Female of the Species

Every Place where we feel safety is a Treasure.Jan Jansen - Jan Jansen
Whenever he can, Werner records what the partisans say on magnetic tape. Everybody, he is learning, likes to hear themselves talk. Hubris, like the oldest stories. They raise the antenna too high, broadcast for too many minutes, assume the world offers safety and rationality when of course it does not. - Anthony Doerr, All the Light We Cannot See

Is love this misguided need to have you beside me most of the time? Is love this safety I feel in our silences? Is it this belonging, this completeness? - Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, Half of a Yellow Sun
He smells safe, too, like sunlit walks in the orchard and silent breakfastsin the dining hall. And in the moments before I drift off to sleep, I almost forget about our war-torn city and all the conflict that willcome to find us soon, if we don't find it first. - Veronica Roth, Insurgent
One narcissus among the ordinary beautiful flowers, one unlike all the others! She pulled, stooped to pull harder-when, sprung out of the earthon his glittering terriblecarriage, he claimed his due.It is finished. No one had heard her.No one! She had strayed from the herd. (Remember: go straight to school.This is important, stop fooling around!Don't answer to strangers. Stickwith your playmates. Keep your eyes down.)This is how easily the pitopens.

Both wet to the bone, exhausted, and one unconscious, Kedean thought, all in all, they were faring rather well for two unarmed men who'd only just an hour ago escaped a fleet of fairy pirates into frigid water in unknown territory. - Anihyr Moonstar, The Coquette and the Thane
He wraps his arms around me and holds me tight for a few seconds. Hisbreaths tickle my ear, and I close my eyes, letting myself finally relax. Hesmells like wind and sweat and soap, like Tobias and like safety. - Veronica Roth, Allegiant
A wise woman protects her kids. A wiser woman hangs out with police officers, retired FBI agents and private investigators. - Shannon L. Alder

Safety is largely an illusion, and panic knows this. - Rita Zoey Chin, Let the Tornado Come: A Memoir
She had expressed herself, as women will, in a smug broadside of pastel shades. Nothing clashed because nothing had the strength to clash; everything murmured of safety among the hues; all was refinement. - Mervyn Peake, Gormenghast
Many of the signals that either stoke or diminish female desire have to do with the female brain's question: Is it safe here? - Naomi Wolf, Vagina: A New Biography

Being tame is what we're taught: ... put the crayons back, stay in line, don't talk too loud, keep your knees together, nice girls don't...As you might know, nice girls DO, and they like to feel wild and alive. Being tame feels safe, being wild, unsafe. Yet safety is an illusion anyway. We are not in control. No matter how dry and tame and nice we live, we will die. And we will suffer along the way. Living wild is its own reward. - S.A.R.K.
I never thought I'd hear myself say it, but safety first! - J.K. Rowling, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows

Safety comes in our nearness to God, not in our distance from our enemies. - Dillon Burroughs, Hunger No More: A 1-Year Devotional Journey Through the Psalms
Peri went to the window, gesturing out at the dragons, perched and flying, everywhere. "Safe, true, but how boring! How confining! How sad! How could that compare with this? And what is safe? You were not safe on your little farm. War came to you and took all your safety away! If I am to be in this world, I want more than to be a hound upon the game board, tucked away in a corner until the jackals come and sweep all away! - Mercedes Lackey, Aerie

To bankrupt a fool, give him information. - Nassim Nicholas Taleb, The Bed of Procrustes: Philosophical and Practical Aphorisms
People today are in danger of drowning in information; but, because they have been taught that information is useful, they are more willing to drown than they need be. If they could handle information, they would not have to drown at all. - Idries Shah, Reflections
A pet rock is a serious commitment and too much responsibility for a ten year old to handle on his own - Kyle Adams, Dirty Zero
Everybody gets so much information all day long that they lose their common sense. They listen so much that they forget to be natural. This is a nice story. - Gertrude Stein, Selected Operas and Plays

When you close to me, my heart has created a vibration of the precise "Carrier frequency" to send all deep information about me to you - cG9sYXJhZGl0aWE=
We all behave like Maxwell's demon. Organisms organize. In everyday experience lies the reason sober physicists across two centuries kept this cartoon fantasy alive. We sort the mail, build sand castles, solve jigsaw puzzles, separate wheat from chaff, rearrange chess pieces, collect stamps, alphabetize books, create symmetry, compose sonnets and sonatas, and put our rooms in order, and all this we do requires no great energy, as long as we can apply intelligence. We propagate structure (not just we humans but we who are alive). We disturb the tendency toward equilibrium. It would be absurd to attempt a thermodynamic accounting for such processes, but it is not absurd to say we are reducing entropy, piece by piece. Bit by bit. The original demon, discerning one molecules at a time, distinguishing fast from slow, and operating his little gateway, is sometimes described as â€œsuperintelligent,â€ but compared to a real organism it is an idiot savant. Not only do living things lessen the disorder in their environments; they are in themselves, their skeletons and their flesh, vesicles and membranes, shells and carapaces, leaves and blossoms, circulatory systems and metabolic pathways - miracles of pattern and structure. It sometimes seems as if curbing entropy is our quixotic purpose in the universe. - James Gleick, The Information: A History, a Theory, a Flood
Information, defined intuitively and informally, might be something like 'uncertainty's antidote.' This turns out also to be the formal definition- the amount of information comes from the amount by which something reduces uncertainty...The higher the [information] entropy, the more information there is. It turns out to be a value capable of measuring a startling array of things- from the flip of a coin to a telephone call, to a Joyce novel, to a first date, to last words, to a Turing test...Entropy suggests that we gain the most insight on a question when we take it to the friend, colleague, or mentor of whose reaction and response we're least certain. And it suggests, perhaps, reversing the equation, that if we want to gain the most insight into a person, we should ask the question of qhose answer we're least certain... Pleasantries are low entropy, biased so far that they stop being an earnest inquiry and become ritual. Ritual has its virtues, of course, and I don't quibble with them in the slightest. But if we really want to start fathoming someone, we need to get them speaking in sentences we can't finish. - Brian Christian, The Most Human Human: What Talking with Computers Teaches Us About What It Means to Be Alive
We have met the Devil of Information Overload and his impish underlings, the computer virus, the busy signal, the dead link, and the PowerPoint presentation. - James Gleick, The Information: A History, a Theory, a Flood
[W]hen a message is squeezed through a twenty-second news spot, so much can be lost that what is left will fail to move anyone enough to make them turn off the set and actually do something. Meanwhile, the viewers will believe that they have learned everything they need to know on that subject and will be bored the next time they hear it. - Jerry Mander, Four Arguments for the Elimination of Television
Religious ceremonies are of paramount importance in Bali ( an island, don't forget, with seven unpredictable volcanoes on it-you would pray, too). - Elizabeth Gilbert, Eat, Pray, Love
Keep in mind that when we limit our exposure to information, or when information itself is scarce, our picture of reality suffers. We become oblivious to both opportunities and hazards. Trends become invisible. History disappears. It's really just two sides of the same coin: the first commitment is as much a commitment to gathering information, from as many sources and in as much volume as can constructively be used, as it is a commitment to facing the facts. - John Salka, First In, Last Out: Leadership Lessons from the New York Fire Department
I think Jay is in import and export business as his cards say, but he finally found that the second most valuable commodity today is information.""And?""The most valuable?""People with information," I suggested. - Len Deighton, The Ipcress File
We either need an overwhelming force advantage, or we need more information.""Reinforcements cut into our bounty, remember?""It's unanimous. We need more information. - Howard Tayler, The Blackness Between

people tell you so much more when they know you're just about to be dead . and then they talk around you, when you are. - Neil Gaiman, Neverwhere
Trade isn't about goods. Trade is about information. Goods sit in the warehouse until information moves them. - C.J. Cherryh, Chanur's Legacy
Careful evaluation of information that is portrayed as fact is critical. - Steven Redhead, Life Is A Cocktail
An echo is an imperfect copy of the original, it is information but it is information from a different time and place. - R.A.Delmonico
The integration of information and vulnerabilities move together. - R.A.Delmonico
Perfect truth (symmetry) is information that doesn't change and pure randomness is a difference that doesn't make a difference. - R.A.Delmonico
Information is a difference that makes a difference. Truth is information that doesn't change and self referential noise is a difference that doesn't make a difference. - R.A.Delmonico
As the complexity in any system increases, the ability to form a correct understanding decreases exponentially. - R.A.Delmonico
Remember this: of all the commodities men trade in, information is the most valuable by far. - Raymond E. Feist, Rise of a Merchant Prince
The bit is a fundamental particle of a different sort: not just tiny but abstractâ€”a binary digit, a flip-flop, a yes-or-no. It is insubstantial, yet as scientists have finally come to understand information, they wonder whether it may be primary: more fundamental than matter itself. They suggest that the bit is the irreducible kernel and that information forms the very core of existence. - James Gleick
Nowhere in the world, Rud reflected, was journalism anything but a malignant and wanton power. Later on, as the Common-sense Movement grew, he had to think a lot about that. He had to spread a new system of ideas throughout the world, and journalism would neither instruct nor inform nor lend itself consistently to any sustained propaganda. - H.G. Wells, The Holy Terror
The point is that newspapers are not there for spreading news but for covering it up. X happens, you have to report it, but it causes embarrassment for too many people, so in the same edition you add some shock headlines - mother kills four children, savings at risk of going up in smoke, letter from Garibaldi insulting his lieutenant Nino Bixio discovered, etc. - so news drowns in a great sea of information. - Umberto Eco, Numero zero
Life is about information, not about something else who knows the most he always wins. - Deyth Banger
Like physical events with their causal and teleological interpretations, every linguistic event had two possible interpretations: as a transmission of information and as the realization of a plan. - Ted Chiang, Stories of Your Life and Others
Information is information, not matter or energy. - Norbert Wiener, Cybernetics: or the Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine
Information is the coin of war. - Terry Goodkind, The First Confessor
The hardest bit of information to extract is the first piece. - Robert Ferrigno, Prayers for the Assassin
The most common definition of [the word information] is: "the action of informing; formation or molding of the mind or character, training, instruction, teaching; communication of instructive knowledge.This definition remained fairly constant until the years immediately following World War II, when it came in vogue to use 'information' as a technological term to define anything that was sent over an electric or mechanical channel. 'Information' became part of the vocabulary of the science of messages. And, suddenly, the appellation could be applied to something that didn't necessarily have to inform. This definition was extrapolated to general usage as something told or communicated, whether or not it made sense to the receiver. Now, the freedom engendered by such an amorphous definition has, as you might expect, encouraged its liberal deployment. It has become the single most important word of our decade, the suspense of our lives and our work. - Richard Saul Wurman, Information Anxiety

What we actually know firsthand is minuscule: the feel of the spring air on our skin, our own private daydreams and phobias. Outside of these tiny warrens of private knowledge, we have to depend on what others say. - Christopher L. Hayes, Twilight of the Elites: America After Meritocracy
Imagine a weary sailor coming home to port in the midst of a brutal storm. Along the horizon he sees the burning lights of dozens of lighthouses. And yet he knows from experience that some are so old they've receded miles inland as the shore has grown. Others are simply fakes, put out by sadists and rivals. To be a citizen in these strange times is to perpetually find oneself in that poor sailor's perilous state. We know that danger lurks in the darkness, but we don't know if we have the means to avoid it. - Christopher L. Hayes, Twilight of the Elites: America After Meritocracy
Time isn't just a quantity. It's information. - Khalid Masood
You may not want to hear that or think of it as writing, but I'm telling you that the moving of information is a literary act in and of itself. Even when people aren't reading it. - Kenneth Goldsmith
Signals always point to something. In this sense, a signal is not a thing but a relationship. Data becomes useful knowledge of something that matters when it builds a bridge between a question and an answer. This connection is the signal. - Stephen Few, Signal: Understanding What Matters in a World of Noise
Everything that informs us of something useful that we didn't already know is a potential signal. If it matters and deserves a response, its potential is actualized. - Stephen Few
There is only one limitation to our progress and that is our lack of information. - Sunday Adelaja
...we are overwhelmed with information and dying for wisdom. - Mark Batterson, A Trip Around the Sun: Turning Your Everyday Life Into the Adventure of a Lifetime
IT IS A KNOWING. YOU BEHAVE LIKE THAT BECAUSE OF AN INFORMATION YOU HAVE. I WILL BEHAVE LIKE YOU IF I HAD THAT INFORMATION.In the beginning was the INFORMATION, and the INFORMATION was with God, and the INFORMATION was God.The same was in the beginning with God.All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.In him was life; and the life was the light of men.And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not. - Mary Tornyenyor( From Sam)
The next question is how? How does news find us? What you need is a certain critical literacy about the fact that you are almost always subject to an algorithm. The most powerful thing in your world now is an algorithm about which you know nothing about. - Kelly McBride
The really strange thing about this is that it was one of the Fog Facts.That is, it was not a secret. It was known. But it was not known. That is, if you asked a knowledgeable journalist, or political analyst, or a historian, they knew about it. If you yourself went and checked the record, you could find it out. But if you asked the man in the street if President Scott, who loved to have his picture taken among the troops and driving armored vehicles and aboard naval vessels, if you asked if Scott had found a way to evade service in Vietnam, they wouldn't have a clue, and, unless they were anti-Scott already, they wouldn't believe it.In the information age there is so much information that sorting and focus and giving the appropriate weight to anything have become incredibly difficult. Then some fact, or event, or factoid mysteriously captures the world's attention and there's a media frenzy. Like Clinton and Lewinsky. Like O. J. Simpson. And everybody in the world knows everything about it. On the flip side are the Fog Facts, important things that nobody seems able to focus on any more than the can focus on a single droplet in the mist. They are known, but not known. - Larry Beinhart, The Librarian
For a moment I think we were turned into information, and that in that instant we were linked to every other piece of information ever known; every thought ever thought, or at least ever captured by the light. - Alastair Reynolds, Revelation Space
Give the people contests they win by remembering the words to more popular songs or the names of state capitals or how much corn Iowa grew last year. Cram them full of noncombustible data, chock them so damned full of 'facts' they feel stuffed, but absolutely 'brilliant' with information. Then they'll feel they're thinking, they'll get a sense of motion without moving. And they'll be happy, because facts of that sort don't change. Don't give them any slippery stuff like philosophy or sociology to tie things up with. That way lies melancholy. - Ray Bradbury, Fahrenheit 451
They tell me we're living in an information age, but none of it seems to be the information I need or brings me closer to what I want to know. In fact (I'm becoming more and more convinced) all this electronic wizardry only adds to our confusion, delivering inside scoops and verdicts about events that have hardly begun: a torrent of chatter moving at the speed of light, making it nearly impossible for any of the important things to be heard - Matthew Flaming, The Kingdom of Ohio
Processed data is information.Processed information is knowledgeProcessed knowledge is Wisdom. - Ankala V Subbarao
Do not believe all that you hear and see.Always check the original source of information. - Lailah Gifty Akita
We know that children with autism like order, that they are often very visual and that they can be quite literal. They deserve beautiful resources and symbols that make sense. If a picture does not explain visually, it is pointless and the child will stop looking to the pictures for information. - Adele Devine, Colour Coding for Learners with Autism: A Resource Book for Creating Meaning through Colour at Home and School
It is more informative how we treat things with no defined legal rights, than how we treat things with legal rights. - Bryant McGill, Simple Reminders: Inspiration for Living Your Best Life
We just start putting our ideas out there, yet how do we actually attack contemporary problems? We do what some of the most successful American businesses do. We outsource and collaborate - Baratunde R. Thurston
Every creature is a living instruction that runs the algorithm of nature. - Joey Lawsin, Creation by Law
It was called the Middle Ages, the Dark Ages. If not for the monks, everything the world had ever learned would have been lost. Well, we live in a similar time, when we're losing the vast majority of what we do and see and learn. But it doesn't have to be that way. - Dave Eggers, The Circle
Here's the bottom line: The secret world of intelligence--at least in the United States of America--represents everything wrong with the government, the industrial era, our financial-economic system, and our ethics. - Robert David Steele, The Open-Source Everything Manifesto: Transparency, Truth, and Trust
Explain to me again why we're at a whorehouse?â€Gwenvael sighed around his ale. â€œBecause, my thick-headedbrother, if you want information about human men then you go to theone place all human men come to eventually. - G.A. Aiken, About a Dragon
The Plutocracy's insatiable hunger for pixelated information is enough to put a bulimic Pac-Man to shame - Dean Cavanagh
Most commanders wanted as many good sources of information as possible. MacArthur was focused on limiting and controlling his sources of intelligence. - David Halberstam, The Coldest Winter: America and the Korean War
I am not alone in the conviction that real, lasting national security can best be obtained through complete transparency of government, business, and other facets of society, and this includes open access to all of the many available types of information. - Robert David Steele, The Open-Source Everything Manifesto: Transparency, Truth, and Trust
I realized in 1988 that my life as a spy specializing in secrets was not only unproductive, it was in sharp opposition to what we actually need: full access to true information, and consequently, the ability to create Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT). - Robert David Steele, The Open-Source Everything Manifesto: Transparency, Truth, and Trust
Liberation technology creates wealth, and open-source technology creates wealth. In both instances the 'center of gravity' for dramatic change toward resilience and sustainability is the human brain mass of five billion poor--the one billion rich have failed to 'scale.' The human brain is the one unlimited resource we have on Earth. - Robert David Steele, The Open-Source Everything Manifesto: Transparency, Truth, and Trust
I will say that again in a different way: the persistent unethical and ignorant emphasis on secrecy and on making decisions for partisan advantage or to pay off campaign contributors and select insiders is not sustainable. We the People have an opportunity to embrace this manifesto of Open-Source Everything and bury 'rule of secrecy.' This is why I am optimistic about the future. - Robert David Steele, The Open-Source Everything Manifesto: Transparency, Truth, and Trust
...our students should be playing Beethoven with research processes, but instead we are hearing Mary Had a Little Lamb. - William Badke
Hunter-gathers, by nature, store information for use, understanding that there may be a time when information is scarce. - Brian C. O'Connor, Jud H. Copeland, Jodi L. Kearns
You have to start with the truth. The truth is the only way that we can get anywhere. Because any decision-making that is based upon lies or ignorance can't lead to a good conclusion. - Julian Assange
A surfeit of information often hides an untruth,â€ he said, with annoying clarity. - Jasper Fforde, Shades of Grey
Thinking about language, while thinking _in_ language, leads to puzzles and paradoxes. - James Gleick
We all would like to know more and, at the same time, to receive less information. In fact, the problem of a worker in today's knowledge industry is not the scarcity of information but its excess. The same holds for professionals: just think of a physician or an executive, constantly bombarded by information that is at best irrelevant. In order to learn anything we need time. And to make time we must use information filters allowing us to ignore most of the information aimed at us. We must ignore much to learn a little. - Mario Bunge, Philosophy in Crisis: The Need for Reconstruction
Information can be such a double-edged sword. - Jessiqua Wittman, A Memoir of Love
I believe we inherit a great river of knowledge, a flow of patterns coming from many sources. The information that comes from deep in the evolutionary past we call genetics. The information passed along from hundreds of years ago we call culture. The information passed along from decades ago we call family, and the information offered months ago we call education. But it is all information that flows through us. The brain is adapted to the river of knowledge and exists only as a creature in that river. Our thoughts are profoundly molded by this long historic flow, and none of us exists, self-made, in isolation from it. - David Brooks
While information is the oxygen of the modern age, disinformation is the carbon monoxide that can poison generations. - Newton Lee, Counterterrorism and Cybersecurity: Total Information Awareness
When you have the means and information to cure a disease and don't . . . you are the disease. - Richard Diaz
Warning:This data storage unit, or "book," has been designed to reprogram the human brain, allowing it to replicate the lost art that was once called reading. It is a simple adjustment and there will be no negative or harmful effects from this process.What you are doing: "Reading" ExplainedEach sheet is indelibly printed with information and the sheets are visually scanned from left to right, and from top to bottom.This scanned information is passed through the visual cortex directly into the brain, where it can then be accessed just like any other data. - Mike A. Lancaster
...If I were to feed strangers my information, they wouldn't have enough time to expose themselves to the world. - Sarah Mercado
Deciding what to read is also a matter of filtering. - Jean-Claude CarriÃ¨re, Violence & Compassion His Holiness The Dalai Lama
We know that we are continually subjected to a huge range of sensory inputs and internal experiences of sensations and thoughts. In fact, almost anything existing in our universe, that can come into human and other animals' purview, can be experienced as information - a bird call, our friend's 'hello,' the rock we trip over, the intuition we have about the honesty of someone we are talking to, a book we read. - Marcia J. Bates

Like any normal fifth grader, I preferred my villains to be evil and stay that way, to act like Dracula rather than Frankenstein's monster, who ruined everything by handing that peasant girl a flower. He sort of made up for it by drowning her a few minutes later, but, still, you couldn't look at him the same way again. - David Sedaris, When You Are Engulfed in Flames
Oh," the girl said, shaking her head. "Don't be so simple. People adore monsters. They fill their songs and stories with them. They define themselves in relation to them. You know what a monster is, young shade? Power. Power and choice. Monsters make choices. Monsters shape the world. Monsters force us to become stronger, smarter, better. They sift the weak from the strong and provide a forge for the steeling of souls. Even as we curse monsters, we admire them. Seek to become them, in some ways." Her eyes became distant. "There are far, far worse things to be than a monster. - Jim Butcher, Ghost Story

That's what Miss Tick thinks. But it's happening faster than she expected.

Philip doesn't let go, his eyes glinting with rage. "We're gonna survive this thing,and we're gonna do it by being bigger monsters than they are! You understand? There ain't no philosophy, there ain't no grace, there ain't no mercy, there's only us and them, and all they wanna do is eat our ass! So we're gonna fucking eat them! We're gonna chew 'em up and spit 'em out, and we're gonna survive this thing or I will blow a hole through this whole fucked up world! You follow me? You FOLLOW ME! - Robert Kirkman
Leaves that rustled, twigs that scraped and rattled. But the thin shapes weren't falling, they were scurrying head first down the tree-trunks at a speed that seemed to leave time behind. Some of them had no shape they could have lived with, and some might never have had any skin. She saw their shriveled eyes glimmer eagerly and their toothless mouths gape with an identical infantile hunger. Their combined weight bowed the lowest branches while they extended arms like withered sticks to snatch the child. ("With The Angels") - Ramsey Campbell, Best New Horror 22

The strange thing arched its serpentine body to bring its head closer to the bear, all of its many eyes staring straight at him with alien curiosity. The thing looked at the bear.

Nyx had killed a lot of people. She'd let even more die through neglect. Rhys was just one more. I'm the same person, aren't I? she thought. She had burned herself up, only to come out the other side exactly the same.Taite's signal would get out, Nyx knew. It would be soon enough to save *her*. But it would not be soon enough for Rhys. Nyx hardened her jaw. Her hands and feet were still tied. They'd stripped her of her most obvious weapons. She could just wait this out.She saw Rhys register that. But there was no shock.

Not all monsters are filled with darkness.' She wanted him to understand this so badly that her voice trembled.He didn't even hesitate. 'This one is.'She allowed herself a moment to admire Tommy, the way he stood so resolute, like a knight charging after the monster. He just didn't get that this fight wasn't his to wage.'Exactly so,' she finally said.Of course Tommy would think she talking to him. He exhaled as though relieved and the start of a smile eased the tension around his lips. By the time he realized that she'd spoken the words to someone over his shoulder, it was already too late. - Carrie Ryan, Slasher Girls & Monster Boys

I don't want your love unless you know I am repulsive, and love me even as you know it. - Georges Bataille
She hated seeing monsters smile. Monsters should growl and snarl and be done with the pretenses. - Faith McKay, Prophecy Girl
The power of monsters is their ability to fuse opposites, to merge contraries, to subvert rules, to overthrow cognitive barriers, moral distinction, and ontological categories. Monsters overcome the barrier of time itself. Uniting past and present, demonic and divine, guilt and conscience, predator and prey, parent and child, self and alien, our monsters are our innermost selves. - David D. Gilmore, Monsters: Evil Beings, Mythical Beasts, And All Manner Of Imaginary Terrors
Only monsters could slay monsters. - Imraan Coovadia, Tales of the Metric System
Couldn't we camp down by the lakes?â€ Nynaeve asked, patting her face with her kerchief. â€œIt must be cooler down by the water.â€â€œLight,â€ Mat said, â€œI'd just like to stick my head in one of them. I might never take it out.â€Just then something roiled the waters of the nearest lake, the dark water phosphorescing as a huge body rolled beneath the surface. Length on man-thick length sent ripples spreading, rolling on and on until at last a tail rose, waving a point like a wasp's stinger for an instant in the twilight, at least five spans into the air. All along that length fat tentacles writhed like monstrous worms, as many as a centipede's legs. It slid slowly beneath the surface and was gone, only the fading ripples to say it had ever been.Rand closed his mouth and exchanged a look with Perrin. Perrin's yellow eyes were as disbelieving as he knew his own must be. Nothing that big could live in a lake that size. Those couldn't have been hands on those tentacles. They couldn't have been.â€œOn second thought,â€ Mat said faintly, â€œI like it right here just fine. - Robert Jordan, The Eye of the World
I'm not sure we're quite the monsters you want us to be. - Gavin G. Smith, A Quantum Mythology
The more monsterous humanity gets, the more nicer monsters become - Anonymous
But such monsters as sphinxes bring forth the necessary heroes to defeat them, and because such heroes make civilization by the example of monster-taming, without the former there would be no civilization at all. - David D. Gilmore
The real monsters are born, not made. They are the ones who watch behind friendly faces. The ones who come for the innocent trying to steal everything they have, be it their most treasured possessions, their honour or their lives. Not because they must, not because their very existence relies on it but simply because there is a thrill in it for them. To watch a man pierced by wrath and greed die a lonely death, to watch a woman pierced by lust and anger whimper away in fear. It thrills them to watch man burn and bleed. Real monsters love to turn the sound of beautiful life into many a terrified scream. - Narayan Liu, The Masks of Monsters

On old maps, cartographers would draw strange beasts around the margins and write phrases such as "Here be dragons." That's where monsters exist: in the unmapped spaces, in the places where we haven't filled in all the gaps... - Kelly Link
The reason Armand Gamache could go there was because it wasn't totally foreign to him. He knew it because he'd seen his own burned terrain, he'd walked off the familiar and comfortable path inside his own head and heart and seen what festered in the dark. And one day Jean Guy Beauvoir would look at his own monsters, and then be able to recognize others. And maybe this was the day and this was the case. He hoped so. - Louise Penny, A Rule Against Murder

To say that I wished I wasn't there would be a ludicrous understatement, but I'd only ever had the illusion of choice: We have to do this, Hank had said. It's for Ellis. To refuse would have been an act of calculated cruelty. And so, because of my husband's war with his father and their insane obsession with a mythical monster, we'd crossed the Atlantic at the very same time a real madman, a real monster, was attempting to take over the world for his own reasons of ego and pride. - Sara Gruen
Monster or not, he was risking his neck to save her. - Ilsa J Bick, Monsters

I don't remember a single monster before I met you.' he'd told Amphibian. 'Now they seem to be all over the place.''You mean there wasn't anything you were afraid of?' the Amphibian had asked him.'lots.''What did they look like?'It was a funny question.'They didn't look like anything. They were ideas,' Tom told him. 'Like not being able to pay rent, or being lonely.''That's the most terrifying thing I've ever heard.' the Amphibian replied. - Andrew Kaufman, All My Friends are Superheroes

Damn this human who had come into her life and made himself so important to her -  had made coming to terms with her inner monster that much more difficult to bear.
I pictured love as a big hairy giant with a dead fish in his mouth. Grizzly bear claws and his heart half out of his chest cause it's too big and the lungs have to fit. He never stops walking. Over mountains. Through the desert. On top of icy lakes. Past huge cities. And he hunts and kills for you and always comes back with plenty to eat. - Adam Rapp, The Children and the Wolves
Everywhere that we looked, were objects & artifacts reminiscent of a bygone age. of war & destruction, of mankind's determination to rule his neighbour, to prove how mighty he and his people are, yet a romance of days past that I am drawn to like a soul lost and hearing his lovers cries to him - Rob Shepherd, Life with Boris Karloff!
Tis true, Dr. Buzzard, that a silver bullet must be of the largest and heaviest sort to travel with any amount o' range or accuracy.

Monsters are very real. But they're not just creatures. Monsters are everywhere. They're people. They're nightmares...They are the things that we harbor within ourselves. If you remember one thing, even above remembering me, remember that there is not a monster dreamt that hasn't walked once within the soul of a man. - C. Robert Cargill, Dreams and Shadows
Monsters can live inside a person. Sometimes, they know about it. More often, they don't. The monster makes them feel safe, or at the very least, better. As long as you know it's there, you can co-exist with it. Give it what it wants, and it will return the favor. Other times, the monster takes over.Bares its teeth. - Nikki Rae, Sunshine
Their bodies lay flatly on the rocks, and their eyes regarded him with evil interest: but it does not appear that Mr. Fison was afraid, or that he realized that he was in any danger. Possibly his confidence is to be ascribed to the limpness of their attitudes. But he was horrified, of course, and intensely excited and indignant at such revolting creatures preying upon human flesh. He thought they had chanced upon a drowned body. He shouted to them, with the idea of driving them off, and, finding they did not budge, cast about him, picked up a big rounded lump of rock, and flung it at one.And then, slowly uncoiling their tentacles, they all began moving towards him - creeping at first deliberately, and making a soft purring sound to each other. - H.G. Wells
Monsters almost always are culture's way of working out their fears. - Catherynne M. Valente
I'm always looking for the monster. Not even just in horror. I want them in everything. Just give me the monsters. Logical conclusions don't satisfy. Monsters satisfy, absolutely. - Victor LaValle, Big Machine
What if it turns out there really are witches and vampires and werewolves living right here alongside us? After all, what better disguise could there be than to get your image enshrined in the culture of the mass media? Anything that's described in artistic terms and shown in the movies stops being frightening and mysterious. For real horror you need the spoken word, you need an old grandpa sitting on a bench, scaring the grandkids in the evening: 'And then the Master of the house came to him and said: "I won't let you go, I'll tie you up and bind you tight and you'll rot under the fallen branches!"' That's the way to make people wary of anomalous phenomena! Kids sense that, you knowâ€“it's no wonder they love telling stories about the Black Han and the Coffin on Wheels. But modern literature, and especially the movies, it all just dilutes that instinctive horror. How can you feel afraid of Dracula, if he's been killed a hundred times? How can you be afraid of aliens, if our guys always squelch them? Yes, Hollywood is the great luller of human vigilance. A toastâ€“to the death of Hollywood, for depriving us of a healthy fear of the unknown! - Sergei Lukyanenko, Twilight Watch
I cannot be assured ofexactly what I createdbe it madness and monsteror beauty and light. - Stephanie Hemphill, Hideous Love: The Story of the Girl Who Wrote Frankenstein
I can turn into anything," he said with emphasis. "Even another werewolf." When Daisy blinked back at him, too dumbfounded to speak, Talent laughed, heartily. She'd been correct. He was devastating when he truly smiled. "Haven't you learned, woman? You've fallen off the map. Here there be monsters. - Kristen Callihan, Moonglow
Monsters' can help us by giving a tangible form to our secret fears. It is less widely appreciated today that â€˜wonders' such as the unicorn legitimize our hopes. But all imaginary animals, to some degree all animals, are ultimately both monsters and wonders, which assist us by deflecting and absorbing our uncertainties . It is hard to tell â€˜imaginary animals' from symbolic, exemplary, heraldic, stylized, poetic, literary, or stereotypical ones. What is reality? Until we answer that question with confidence, a sharp differentiation between real animals and imaginary ones will remain elusive. There is some yeti in every ape, and a bit of Pegasus in every horse. Men and women are not only part angel and part demon, as the old clichÃ© goes; they are also part centaur, part werewolf, part mandrake, and part sphinx. - Boria Sax, Imaginary Animals: The Monstrous, the Wondrous and the Human
Human beings are no damn good,â€ he said. â€œWe are even worse than animals. We like ...â€He trailed off, cleared his throat, but his voice hardly reached a whisper.â€œWe like monsters,â€ he said. - Victor LaValle, Big Machine
Solomon breathed a sigh of relief ever so slightly, thankful that the cricket had not been eaten. Not that he was concerned for the cricket being eaten. No, he was simply relieved that the voice in the closet, which could be a monster, had not eaten it. If the voice had eaten the cricket, that meant that he was a monster that eats things in the night, and Solomon too could be eaten. Being eaten by a closet monster was perhaps the scariest thing that could happen to an elephant, not to mention a cricket, as far as Solomon was concerned. - Michael Delaware, Scary Elephant Meets the Closet Monster
This was in the good old days, when monsters were fantasy. - Hollis Seamon, Somebody Up There Hates You
Beer gurgled through the beard. 'You see,' the young man began, 'the desert's so big you can't be alone in it. Ever notice that? It's all empty and there's nothing in sight, but there's always something moving over there where you can't quite see it. It's something very dry and thin and brown, only when you look around it isn't there. Ever see it?''Optical fatigue -' Tallant began.'Sure. I know. Every man to his own legend. There isn't a tribe of Indians hasn't got some way of accounting for it. You've heard of the Watchers? And the twentieth-century white man comes along, and it's optical fatigue. Only in the nineteenth century things weren't quite the same, and there were the Carkers.''You've got a special localized legend?''Call it that. You glimpse things out of the corner of your mind, same like you glimpse lean, dry things out of the corner of your eye. You incase 'em in solid circumstance and they're not so bad. That is known as the Growth of Legend. The Folk Mind in Action. You take the Carkers and the things you don't quite see and put 'em together. And they bite.'Tallant wondered how long that beard had been absorbing beer. 'And what were the Carkers?' he prompted politely.'Ever hear of Sawney Bean? Scotland - reign of James the First or maybe the Sixth, though I think Roughead's wrong on that for once. Or let's be more modern - ever hear of the Benders? Kansas in the 1870's? No? Ever hear of Procrustes? Or Polyphemus? Or Fee-fi-fo-fum?'There are ogres, you know. They're no legend. They're fact, they are. The inn where nine guests left for every ten that arrived, the mountain cabin that sheltered travelers from the snow, sheltered them all winter till the melting spring uncovered their bones, the lonely stretches of road that so many passengers traveled halfway - you'll find 'em everywhere. All over Europe and pretty much in this country too before communications became what they are. Profitable business. And it wasn't just the profit. The Benders made money, sure; but that wasn't why they killed all their victims as carefully as a kosher butcher. Sawney Bean got so he didn't give a damn about the profit; he just needed to lay in more meat for the winter.'And think of the chances you'd have at an oasis.''So these Carkers of yours were, as you call them, ogres?''Carkers, ogres - maybe they were Benders. The Benders were never seen alive, you know, after the townspeople found those curiously butchered bodies. There's a rumor they got this far West. And the time checks pretty well. There wasn't any town here in the 80s. Just a couple of Indian families - last of a dying tribe living on at the oasis. They vanished after the Carkers moved in. That's not so surprising. The white race is a sort of super-ogre, anyway. Nobody worried about them. But they used to worry about why so many travelers never got across this stretch of desert. The travelers used to stop over at the Carkers, you see, and somehow they often never got any further. Their wagons'd be found maybe fifteen miles beyond in the desert. Sometimes they found the bones, too, parched and white. Gnawed-looking, they said sometimes.''And nobody ever did anything about these Carkers?''Oh, sure. We didn't have King James the Sixth - only I still think it was the First - to ride up on a great white horse for a gesture, but twice there were Army detachments came here and wiped them all out.''Twice? One wiping-out would do for most families.'Tallant smiled at the beery confusion of the young man's speech.'Uh-huh, That was no slip. They wiped out the Carkers twice because you see once didn't do any good. They wiped 'em out and still travelers vanished and still there were white gnawed bones. So they wiped 'em out again. After that they gave up, and people detoured the oasis.("They Bite") - Anthony Boucher, Zacherley's Vulture Stew
Mais c'est renfantillage - this is childishness!' we heard de Grandin pant as we closed in and sought a chance to seize his skeleton-like antagonist. 'He who fights an imp of Satan as if he were human is a fool!'("The Man In Crescent Terrace") - Seabury Quinn, The Mummy Walks Among Us

Art, like Nature, has her monsters - Oscar Wilde, The Picture of Dorian Gray
How different this world to the one about which I used to read, and in which I used to live! This is one peopled by demons, phantoms, vampires, ghouls, boggarts, and nixies. Names of things of which I knew nothing are now so familiar that the creatures themselves appear to have real existence. The Arabian Nights are not more fantastic than our gospels; and Lempriere would have found ours a more marvelous world to catalog than the classical mythical to which he devoted his learning. Ours is a world of luprachaun and clurichaune, deev and cloolie, and through the maze of mystery I have to thread my painful way, now learning how to distinguish oufe from pooka, and nis from pixy; study long screeds upon the doings of effreets and dwergers, or decipher the dwaul of delirious monks who have made homunculi from refuse. Waking or sleeping, the image of some uncouth form is always present to me. What would I not give for a volume by the once despised 'A. L. O. E' or prosy Emma Worboise? Talk of the troubles of Winifred Bertram or Jane Eyre, what are they to mine? Talented authoresses do not seem to know that however terrible it may be to have as a neighbour a mad woman in a tower, it is much worse to have to live in a kitchen with a crocodile. This elementary fact has escaped the notice of writers of fiction; the re-statement of it has induced me to reconsider my decision as to the most longed-for book; my choice now is the Swiss Family Robinson. In it I have no doubt I should find how to make even the crocodile useful, or how to kill it, which would be still better.("Mysterious Maisie") - Wirt Gerrare, Gaslit Nightmares: Stories by Robert W. Chambers, Charles Dickens, Richard Marsh, and Others

She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear, and bit her bottom lip. I found it to be such an erotic gesture that it aroused me. My eyes began making love to her in the dark. Unseen hands passed over her curves, quietly descending...trembling at her great beauty. I didn't even know her, but I wanted her. My gaze danced over her every curve, from her nose and lips, to her breasts and hips, surreptitiously. She had no idea of my thoughts. Shadow sex. - Rae Hachton, Frankie's Monster
He looks at Mr. Vacanti and the man looks back at him with somehow gentle eyes. It surprises David to see the man has gentle eyes. It surprises him, even at thirty-seven, to discover that monsters can have gentle eyes. Something is terribly wrong with a world where monsters are allowed to have gentle eyes. - Ryan David Jahn, Good Neighbors

When a man died, there had to be blame. Jimmy Cross understood this. You could blame the war, You could blame the idiots who made the war. You could blame Kiowa for going to it. You could blame the rain. You could blame the river. You could blame the field, the mud, the climate. You could blame the enemy. You could blame the mortar rounds. You could blame people who were too lazy to read a newspaper, who were bored by the daily body counts, who switched channels at the mention of politics. You could blame whole nations. You could blame God. You could blame the munitions makers or Karl Marx or a trick of fate of an old man in Omaha who forgot to vote. - Tim O'Brien, The Things They Carried

Exploration! Exploring the past! We students in the camps seminar considered ourselves radical explorers. We tore open the windows and let in the air, the wind that finally whirled away the dust that society had permitted to settle over the horrors of the past. We made sure people could see. And we placed no reliance on legal scholarship. It was evident to us that there had to be convictions. It was just as evident as conviction of this or that camp guard or police enforcer was only the prelude. The generation that had been served by the guards and enforcers, or had done nothing to stop them, or had not banished them from its midst as it could have done after 1945, was in the dock, and we explored it, subjected it to trial by daylight, and condemned it to shame. - Bernhard Schlink, The Reader

They came to the high stone shaft with the face of Sul; they descended to the terrace below. And here Caradog waited, leaning on his silver-tipped rod and eying the horizon, until the delicate slip of the new moon moved out from behind the shoulder of Mount Damyake, with the mysterious, shadowy ghost of the old moon cradle inside it, like an egg inside its egg cup."Now it is time," he - Joan Aiken, The Stolen Lake

Engaged Audience Members are receptive to the messages of dangerous speech and to condoning group-targeted harm, but are not hardliners. For example, they may be easily influenced by charismatic leaders who promise to resolve their grievances, or be receptive to blame narratives. This could be any member of society, but certain types of people (based on demographic or other characteristics) may be disproportionately engaged. - Rachel Hilary Brown, Defusing Hate: A Strategic Communication Guide to Counteract Dangerous Speech

Due to our act of Personal Irresponsibility, illegal businesses are set-up, our neighbourhoods are not secured and the economy directly and indirectly takes a big hit. The government alone cannot be blamed for this, because this is our neighbourhood and if we cannot take care of our immediate surroundings, then we are clearly not carrying out our responsibilities and we don't have any business blaming someone else. - Sunday Adelaja

I reckon that blaming people fixes nothing. You're the only person who is going to sort you out. No-one else really can - or really cares, enough. That's what Nepalis know - better than anyone.

Being the bearer of bad news is a terrible thing; sometimes you don't know if you'll have the words, the delicacy,the strength. You think of the person on the other side: how you're about to bring their world crashing down with a single phone call and deep inside them they'll hate you because their sorrow will just be searching for someone to blame. Then what do you say? That you're sorry? Sorry for what? They'll hate you even more because they'll know you're not sorry like they are. They'll know you haven't been destroyed like they have. - Emma Abdullah, The Blue Box
Although stigmatizing attitudes are not limited to mental illness, the public seems to disapprove persons with psychiatric disabilities significantly more than persons with related conditions such as physical illness (34-36). Severe mental illness has been likened to drug addiction, prostitution, and criminality (37,38). Unlike physical disabilities, persons with mental illness are perceived by the public to be in control of their disabilities and responsible for causing them (34,36). Furthermore, research respondents are less likely to pity persons with mental illness, instead reacting to psychiatric disability with anger and believing that help is not deserved (35,36,39)."World Psychiatry. 2002 Feb; 1(1): 16â€“20.PMCID: PMC1489832Understanding the impact of stigma on people with mental illnessPATRICK W CORRIGAN and AMY C WATSON - Patrick W.

She knew there were words so terrible you heard them with your whole body. Guilty. And there were voices to say them. She knew there were people you might almost trust who would hear them, too, and be amazed, and still not really hear them because they know they were not the ones the words were spoken to. - Marilynne Robinson, Lila

When you blame others you are effectively proclaiming that you are only response to stimuli. - Bryant McGill, Simple Reminders: Inspiration for Living Your Best Life
How can God allow this to happen? How can our predecessors allow this to happen? How can YOU allow this to happen? We could all blame everyone else for the problems of the past that brought us the present, but that doesn't do us any good. The past has already been written, and there's nothing you can do about it. The only thing you can do is concentrate on making it a better place today. Be the present example by following your heart and not worrying what others are doing. - Jason Micheal Ratliff

Perfectionist parents seem to operate under the illusion that if they can just get their children to be perfect, they will be a perfect family. They put the burden of stability on the child to avoid facing the fact that they, as parents, cannot provide it. The child fails and becomes the scapegoat for family problems. Once again, the child is saddled with the blame. - Susan Forward, Toxic Parents: Overcoming Their Hurtful Legacy and Reclaiming Your Life
Scared people don't really mean what they say, they're just looking for ways to rationalize everything so they have someone or something to blame. They need to have a reason for what's happening because when they have that they can take comfort in knowing it's out of their control. - Chris Dietzel, The Man Who Watched The World End
To fundamentally solve a problem, we must understand it's cause. In that I mean the chain of actions or circumstances that led to the problem--rather than only the immediate cause, which serves only to place blame. - Charlie Herrick

Why do women always do this? Why are they so eager to blame themselves when someone treats them like sh*t? A guy would take a cheese grater to his tongue before admitting he screwed up. - Emma Chase, Tangled
When discouraged some people will give up, give in or give out far too early. They blame their problems on difficult situations, unreasonable people or their own inabilities.When discouraged other people will push back that first impulse to quit, push down their initial fear, push through feelings of helplessness and push ahead. They're less likely to find something to blame and more likely to find a way through. - Steve Goodier
Blame the economy, blame bad luck, blame my parents, blame your parents, blame the Internet, blame people who use the Internet. - Gillian Flynn, Gone Girl
No Blame: The most liberating and empowering day of my life was the day I freed myself from my own self-destructive nonsense. - Steve Maraboli, Unapologetically You: Reflections on Life and the Human Experience
There has to be blame and there has to be reasons and there has to be answers and if nobody can adequately accept the blame and give a sufficient reason and provide an answer, the love, no matter how strong it is, the family, no matter how tight it is, the life, no matter how good it is, will always buckle, then snap, then drown completely under the pressure of itself, the reality of the mistrust, and the weight of its own history, because if there are no answers, the blame and the guilt become stronger than the love and those two things together become a force that no amount of love can ever break down and overcome. - Jason Myers, Dead End
Perhaps it was as well that she had been unconscious for four weeks. She had missed the aftermath, the SO-1 reports, the recriminations, Snood and Tamworth's funerals. She missed everything...except the blame. It was waiting for her when she awoke... - Jasper Fforde, The Eyre Affair

It is a happy talent to know how to play. - Ralph Waldo Emerson
We shed as we pick up, like travellers who must carry everything in their arms, and what we let fall will be picked up by those behind. The procession is very long and life is very short. We die on the march. But there is nothing outside the march so nothing can be lost to it. The missing plays of Sophocles will turn up piece by piece, or be written again in another language. Ancient cures for diseases will reveal themselves once more. Mathematical discoveries glimpsed and lost to view will have their time again. You do not suppose, my lady, that if all of Archimedes had been hiding in the great library of Alexandria, we would be at a loss for a corkscrew? - Tom Stoppard, Arcadia

Oh, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!It seems she hangs upon the cheek of nightLike a rich jewel in an Ethiope's ear,Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear.So shows a snowy dove trooping with crowsAs yonder lady o'er her fellows shows.The measure done, I'll watch her place of stand,And, touching hers, make blessÃ¨d my rude hand.Did my heart love till now? Forswear it, sight!For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night. - William Shakespeare

Did I tell you what happened at the play? We were at the back of the theatre, standing there in the dark, when all of a sudden I feel one of 'em tug at my sleeve, whispers, "Trudy look!" I said, "Yeah, goosebumps. You definitely got goosebumps. You like the play that much?" They said it wasn't the play that gave 'em goosebumps, it was the audience!I'd forgot to tell them to watch the play; they'd been watching the audience! Yeah, to see a group of people sitting together in the dark, laughing and crying at the same things...well that just knocked 'em out! They said, "Trudy, the play was soup, the audience, art."So they're taking goosbumps back with 'em into space. Goosebumps! Quite a souvenir. I like to think of them out there in the dark, watching us. Sometimes we'll do something and they'll laugh. Sometimes we'll do something and they'll cry. And maybe, one day we'll do something so magnificent, the whole universe will get goosebumps. - Jane Wagner, The Search for Signs of Intelligent Life in the Universe

At an age when most children love to play with toys, he played with weapons. - Nawab Shafath Ali Khan
Did I live? The human world is like a vast musical instrument on which we play our individual part while simultaneously listening to the compositions of others in an effort to contribute to the whole. We don't chose whether to engage, only how to; we either harmonize or create dissonance. Our words, our deeds, our very presence create and leave impressions in the minds of others just as a writer makes impressions with their words. Who you are is an unfolding narrative. You came from nothing and will return there eventually. Instead of taking ourselves so seriously all the time, we can discover the playful irony of a story that has never been told in quite this way before. -- Stephen Batchelor, Buddhism Without Beliefs - Stephen Batchelor
Through play, children experience a greater confidence in their bodies, surroundings and themselves. They become familiar with what they can and cannot do. - Iben Dissing Sandahl, Play The Danish Way: A Guide to Raising Balanced, Resilient and Healthy Children through Play

That one has to be playing in order to be playing a game seems equally implausible. When professional athletes are performing in assigned games for wages, although they are certainly playing games, we are not at all inclined to conclude from that fact that they are without qualification playing. For we think of professional athletes as working when they play their games and as playing when they go home from work to romp with their children. - Bernard Suits

Play invites participation. - Brian Goodwin
After graduating early from high school, I carefully listened to the quarterback during my first play in college spring ball. My mind was on the very basics of football: alignment, assignment, and where to stand in the huddle. The quarterback broke the huddle and I ran to the line, meeting the confident eyes of a defensive endâ€”6-foot-6, 260- pound Matt Shaughnessy.I was seventeen, a true freshman, and he was a 23-year-old fifth-year senior, a third-round draft pick. Huge difference between the two of us. Impressing the coach was not on my mind. Survival was. â€œOh, Jesus,â€ I said. I wasn't cursing. I was praying for help.Is anyone among you in trouble? Let them pray ( James 5:13).That day Matt came off the ball so fast. Bam! Next thing I knew, I was flat on my back, thrown to the ground. I got up and limped back to the huddle.Four years later...standing on the sidelines in my first NFL game, bouncing on my toes, waiting for my chance to go in, one of the tight ends went down. My time to shine! Where do I stand? Who do I have? I look up and meet the same eyes I met on my first play in college football.Matt Shaughnessy! ... - Jake Byrne, First and Goal: What Football Taught Me About Never Giving Up

Our point of departure must be the conception of an almost childlike play-sense expressing itself in various play-forms, some serious, some playful, but all rooted in ritual and productive of culture by allowing the innate human need of rhythm, harmony, change, alternation, contrast and climax, etc., to unfold in full richness. - Johan Huizinga, Homo Ludens: A Study of the Play-Element in Culture
For us the chief point of interest is the place where the game is played. Generally it is a simple circle, dyutamandalam, drawn on the ground. The circle as such, however, has a magic significance. It is drawn with great care, all sorts of precautions being taken against cheating. The players are not allowed to leave the ring until they have discharged their obligations. But, sometimes a special hall is provisionally erected for the game, and this hall is holy ground. The Mahabharata devotes a whole chapter to the erection of the dicing hall - sabha - where the Pandavas are to meet their prtners. Games, of chance, therefore, have their serious side. They are included in ritual. - Johan Huizinga, Homo Ludens: A Study of the Play-Element in Culture
Oh, Narcissus! My heart beats ink for you.A pulse in every line.It's your eyesmy words want to be read by,your kind of mindthey would be understood by,your heartthey'd be felt by,and then you'd feel the same way that I do,if only these words could be read or heard by you. - Steven L. Sheppard, The Untold Story Of Narcissus And Echo

He's at war with himself. Why doesn't he surrender to his feelings and stop fighting himself? He has hang-ups that I must cut him loose from. - Steven L. Sheppard, Byblis And Caunus
You really are exotic, for boys in my country, they do not have such pectorals. I like yours. - Steven L. Sheppard, The Untold Story Of Iphis And Ianthe
I think I know what he is REALLY doing in there... and thinking about ME while doing it." (continuing) "But when he thinks of me, he thinks: sister! Think: Byblis! BYBLIS! I don't think of him as my brother, I think of him as CAUNUS! - Steven L. Sheppard, Byblis And Caunus
CURTAIN CALLThe world is our stage and the final act can highlight or ruin a beautiful play - Kamil Ali, Profound Vers-A-Tales
Nice enough?â€ he asked, tendons tightening in his neck like he intended to Hulk out on me. â€œDid you just call my kiss â€˜nice enough'? - Kylie Scott, Play
Life must be lived as play, playing certain games, making sacrifices, singing and dancing, and then a man will be able to propitiate the gods, and defend himself against his enemies, and win in the contest. - Plato
If I am a pawn in someone else's chess game, you better believe I am going to demand an explanation before being shoved at some rook. I'll play my part, damn it, but I want the courtesy of being asked for my consent! - Thomm Quackenbush, Danse Macabre (Night's Dream, #2)
For us the chief point of interest is the place where the game is played. Generatly it is a simple circle, dyutamandalam, drawn on the ground. The circle as such, however, has a magic significance. It is drawn with great care, all sorts of precautions being taken against cheating. The players are not allowed to leave the ring until they have discharged their obligations. But, sometimes a special hall is provisionally erected for the game, and this hall is holy ground.

And I was a Child again, watching the bright World. But the Spell broke when at this Juncture some Gallants jumped from the Pitt onto the Stage and behaved as so many Merry-Andrews among the Actors, which reduced all to Confusion. I laugh'd with them also, for I like to make Merry among the Fallen and there is pleasure to be had in the Observation of the Deformity of Things. Thus when the Play resumed after the Disturbance, it was only to excite my Ridicule with its painted Fictions, wicked Hypocrisies and villainous Customs, all depicted with a little pert Jingle of Words and a rambling kind of Mirth to make the Insipidnesse and Sterility pass. There was no pleasure in seeing it, and nothing to burden the Memory after: like a voluntarie before a Lesson it was absolutely forgotten, nothing to be remembered or repeated. - Peter Ackroyd, Hawksmoor
I hate when people play politics with me -  when I have never tried to play politics with anyone. I always try to play fair with everyone. But
Aleksar Greene was a boy I used to play with, he was my imaginary friend. - Shawn Lukas
Aleksar Greene was a boy I used to play with. He was my imaginary friend. - Shawn Lukas
It's human -  we all put self interest first.
Mortal fate is hard. You'd best get used to it. - Euripides, Medea
Old loves are dropped when new ones come - Euripides, Medea
Not too little, not too much: there safety lies. - Euripides, Medea
Who can stop grief's avalanche once it starts to roll. - Euripides, Medea
In childbirth grief begins. - Euripides, Medea
...for nothing is more boring than being forced to play. - Angela Carter, Nights at the Circus
Better a humble heart, a lowly life. Untouched by greatness let me live - and live. Not too little, not too much: there safety lies. - Euripides, Medea
To amuse oneself in order that one may exert oneself, as Anacharsis puts it, seems right; for amusement is a sort of relaxation, and we need relaxation because we cannot work continuously. - Aristotle, The Nicomachean Ethics
You'll like it less when you hear what they've been building. It's a big raised platform at the end of the square about two metres above the ground, with steps running up to it.''Like a stage?' Erak suggested. 'Maybe they're going to put on a play.''Or an execution,' Horace said. - John Flanagan, Erak's Ransom
I hate parties.And a wedding is the biggest party of all.All the guests arrived and Orpheus is taking a shower.He's always taking a shower when the guests arrive so he doesn't have to greet them.Then I have to greet them.A wedding is for daughters and fathers. The mothers all dress up, trying to look like young women. But a wedding is for a father and daughter. They stop being married to each other on that day.I always thought there would be more interesting people at my wedding. - Sarah Ruhl, Eurydice
Orpheus never liked words. He had his music. He would get a funny look on his face and I would say what are you thinking about and he would always be thinking about music. - Sarah Ruhl, Eurydice
Our play is not something separate from our spirituality -  it is itself a sign of the presence of God in the world.
If we were in a restaurant sometimes Orpheus would look sullen and wouldn't talk to me and I thought people felt sorry for me. I should have realized that women envied me. Their husbands talked too much.But I wanted to talk to him about my notions. I was working on a new philosophical system. It involved hats. - Sarah Ruhl, Eurydice
hornier than a bunny on ecstasy - Kyle Adams, Dirty Play
People used to play with toys.Now the toys play with them. - Idries Shah, Reflections
Play hard. Play, play, play like your life depends on it. Because it does. - Dean Koontz
"c.	â€œSo, hunny, don't waste your time trying to label or define meâ€¦'cause I'm not what I was ten years ago or ten minutes ago. I'm all of that and then some. And whereas I can't live inside yesterday's pain, I can't live without it. - George C. Wolfe, The Colored Museum"
Finish the work, otherwise an unfinished work will finish you. - Amit Kalantri
Behind an able Indian Cricket Team there is always able Sachin Tendulkar. - Amit Kalantri, 5 Feet 5 Inch Run Machine â€“ Sachin Tendulkar
If your writing doesn't keep you up at night, it won't keep anyone else up either - James M. Cain
While I'm writing, I'm far away;and when I come back, I've gone. - Pablo Neruda
Don't tell me the moon is shining, show me the glint of light on broken glass. - Bernard Cornwell
The idea that you might end up in a job that doesn't allow you to be who you are, over the course of a lifetime, is still one of the most chilling nightmares to me. It's a good metaphor for fears I have about losing my soul in some accidental, mundane way. So, to me, these jobs that my characters have are very loaded. They immediately suggest a complex character to me, a woman who is, say, a secretary, but also a vigilante on behalf of her own soul. - Miranda July
The business of the novelist is not to relate great events, but to make small ones interesting. - Arthur Schopenhauer, The Works of Schopenhauer: The Wisdom of Life and Other Essays
I can fix a bad page. I can't fix a blank page. - Nora Roberts
Don't write what you knowâ€”what you know may bore you, and thus bore your readers. Write about what interests youâ€”and interests you deeplyâ€”and your readers will catch fire at your words. - Valerie Sherwood
One thing I know for sure about raising children is that every single day a kid needs discipline.... But also every single day a kid needs a break. - Anne Lamott, Bird by Bird: Some Instructions on Writing and Life
Slaying dragons, melting witches, and banishing demons is all fun and games until someone loses a sidekickâ€”then it's personal. The bad guy isn't just the â€œbad guyâ€ anymore, he's the BAD GUY! - Michael J. Sullivan
Part of being a writer is defending your vision and not caving in to outside pressures. - Jennifer Crusie
So I have to create the whole thing afresh for myself each time. Probably all writers now are in the same boat. It is the penalty we pay for breaking with tradition, and the solitude makes the writing more exciting though the being read less so. One ought to sink to the bottom of the sea, probably, and live alone with ones words. - Virginia Woolf, A Writer's Diary
If I ask you to think about something, you can decide not to. But if I make you feel something? Now I have your attention. - Lisa Cron, Wired for Story: The Writer's Guide to Using Brain Science to Hook Readers from the Very First Sentence
You are always naked when you start writing -  you are always as if you had never written anything before
Readers have a loyalty that cannot be matched anywhere else in the creative arts, which explains why so many writers who have run out of gas can keep coasting anyway, propelled on to the bestseller lists by the magic words AUTHOR OF on the covers of their books. - Stephen King, Bag of Bones
Words are the bones. Writing is the lungs. Reading is like breathing. - T.L. Crain
What I don't write is as important as what I write. - Jamaica Kincaid, Generations of Women: In Their Own Words
There are many rules of good writing, but the best way to find them is to be a good reader. - Stephen E. Ambrose
Each letter has a shape, she told them, one shape in the world and no other, and it is your responsibility to make it perfect. - Kim Edwards, The Memory Keeper's Daughter
Writer's block? I've never heard of a plumber complain about plumber's block. - Robert B. Parker
There's no right way of writing. There's only your way. - Milton Lomask
I've come to the end of another book alive. At times like this I'm always at a loss for words. - Joe Coomer, Sailing in a Spoonful of Water
Remember that you don't write a story because you have an idea but because you have a believable character. - Flannery O'Connor
I never really feel that I'm stuck. I actually think that people are never stuck, there's no such thing as writers block, I think that theres terror that can silence you. But if you can think of it as a dynamic thing I mean a writers block, it's a paralysis an immobility and the thing that has immobilized you is a very powerful force. Immobility is itself an act, it's a choice. It can sometimes take as much energy to remain immobile as it does to be mobile. And if you think of it in a dynamic way then it'd freeze you from the sense that at some point your talent will simply abandon you and you're just a vacant shell with nothing to say, I don't think that ever really happens. But I think that terror, bad experience, trauma and so on can absolutely silence you. - Tony Kushner
There is no bombast, no similes, flowers, digressions, or unnecessary descriptions. Everything tends directly to the catastrophe. - Horace Walpole, The Castle of Otranto
I had declared in public my desire to be a writer ... I wanted to develop a curiosity that was oceanic and insatiable as well as a desire to learn and use every word in the English language that didn't sound pretentious or ditzy. - Pat Conroy, My Losing Season: A Memoir
Begin your writing, fiction or article, where the action begins. This action can be internal (e.g., an important insight or personal decision) or external (e.g., a murder or calamity). Begin too early, you lose your reader. Begin too late, you lose your story. - Walt Shiel
Good fiction makes the truth believable. - Tarrant Smith
Formula for success: rise early, work hard, strike oil. J.Paul Getty - Alison  Wong
A successful story always offers its audience more than a simple resolution of events. A story offers a dramatic affirmation of human needs that are acted out to resolution and fulfillment. Even when that resolution and fulfillment are dark, the journey can still be vivid, potent and illuminating. - Bill  Johnson
My rule is never save bits. They get the way, and you don't think of anything new. Put 'em in. Make a big mess. - Gene Wolfe
Write what is important to you, regardless of fashion or marketability or anything like that â€“ all those things are so far out of your control that you may as well not think about them. Of course, this may mean you'll never be published but that's a risk we all take every single time we set hands to keyboard or pen to paper. For me, if I can sit back at the end of a project and say, â€˜yes, I stayed honest, I said what I wanted to say, and I made it sing to the best of my ability', then I'm happy enough. Of course, if anyone wants to buy the damned thing off me when I'm done, that's jam I won't refuse. - Celine Kiernan
To my mind, the most important thing in any form of fiction is the human element, but only if it takes us beyond the everyday, into situations that examine the complexities that may fascinate or puzzle us. To dwell on the mundane as some kind of a writing exeercise is useless. - Graham Worthington, Zorn: A Legend of the Days to Come
The paradox of writing is that you're trying to use words to express what words can't express. - Stephen Fischer
To write a genuine familiar or truly English style, is to write as any one would speak in common conversation who had a thorough command and choice of words, or who could discourse with ease, force, and perspicuity, setting aside all pedantic and oratorical flourishes. - William Hazlitt, Essays
You could say, in a way, that I'm not actually a writer, though perhaps I might be called a recorder? ... I just happen to be one of those holding the pen, that's all. - Etienne de L'Amour, The Lucian Uprising
When you write, it's like braiding your hair. Taking a handful of coarse unruly strands and attempting to bring them unity. Your fingers have still not perfected the task. Some of the braids are long, others are short. Some are thick, others are thin. Some are heavy. Others are light. Like the diverse women of your family. Those whose fables and metaphors, whose similes and soliloquies, whose diction and je ne sais quoi daily slip into your survival soup, by way of their fingers. - Edwidge Danticat, Krik? Krak!
You can't have good ideas unless you have lots of ideas. - Linus Pauling
It was a miracle to me, this transformation of my acorns into an oak. - Betsy Lerner, The Forest for the Trees
I just write whenever I can. - Elmer Kelton
Writing novels is the hardest thing I've ever done, including digging irrigation ditches. - Thomas Harris
There will be pages. Lots and lots of pages. Most of the pages will have letters on them, and a vast majority of these letters will be in the Roman alphabet. - Aaron Allston
God, Himself, wrote the 10 into stone with his own finger. He told the epic of mankind, our origins and our future, in a book. For me, there is no more noble a cause and no more honorable a vocation than to say, like Him, I am a writer. - Gerard de Marigny, Signs of War
Chapter one is where you reach out your hand to the reader and say, "Come, let's have an adventure together. - Tenaya Jayne
I owe all my originality, such as it is, to my determination not to be a literary man. Instead of belonging to a literary club I belong to a municipal council. Instead of drinking and discussing authors and reviews, I sit on committees with capable practical greengrocers and bootmakers... Keep away from books and from men who get their ideas from books, and your own books will always be fresh. - George Bernard Shaw
The root difficulty in all cases was the state of being blind and deaf to words-- not seeing the words for the prose. Being adults, they had forgotten what every child understands, which is giving and taking a meaning is not automatic and inevitable - Jacques Barzun, Simple and Direct: A Rhetoric for Writers
This is important to writing. . . that is, it is important to my own writing. This. . . is landscape! Mine. This dirt came from the prairie where I was a child. I played in it, dug in it, planted in it, and walked over it. It is where I began. And all my writing begins with a landscape such as this. A place. - Patricia MacLachlan, Word After Word After Word
Sometimes you have to tell a a bunch of lies to get at the truth. - Stella Atrium
Travel became distinguishable from pain and began to be regarded as an intellectual pleasur...These factors--the voluntariness of departure, the freedom implicit in the indeterminancies of mobility, the pleasure of travel free from necessity, the notion that travel signifies autonomy and is a means for demonstrating what one 'really' is independent of one context or set of defining associations--remain the characteristics of the modern conception of travel.Eric Leed - Robin Jarvis, Romantic Writing and Pedestrian Travel
Bringing you closer to the fragile edge of living is the job of a writer. - Julie Rodelli
I have this idea that writing is all about divergent thinking colliding with a hurricane of emotions. - R. Y.S. Perez, I Hope You Fall in Love: Poetry Collection
Movies and television may be influencing writers to write more visually, using immediate scenes with specific points of view to put their stories across. But fiction can always accomplish something that visual media will never be able to match....One of the great gifts of literature is that it allows for the expression of unexpressed thoughts: interior monologue. - Renni Browne, Self-Editing for Fiction Writers: How to Edit Yourself Into Print
At the day's end, a writer lives alone with her story, wrestling with characters and settings, and the way light filters into and out of a scene. The deeper messages often escape her.Sometimes I take for granted the journey through the telling. At other times I curse the muse's power. But through it all, I live each day in deep gratitude. - Jacqueline Woodson, Another Brooklyn
Rejection sucks. It sucks every time, whether it's a big suck or a little suck. But it's part of the process. It's part of being a writer. It's a badge that says 'I'm serious about this, and I'm sending out my work. - Allison K. Williams, Get Published in Literary Magazines: The Indispensable Guide to Preparing, Submitting and Writing Better
All great movies have one thing in common: every frame of every scene could stand alone as a work of art. Why should it be different in a book? - Sean Hinn
Why do you never find anything written about that idiosyncratic thought you advert to, about your fascination with something no one else understands? Because it is up to you. There is something you find interesting, for a reason hard to explain because you have never read it on any page; there you begin. You were made and set here to give voice to this, your own astonishment. - Annie Dillard, The Abundance: Narrative Essays Old and New
An obscure flesh-and-blood Gascon, forgotten by History, transformed into a legendary giant by the novelist's genius - Arturo PÃ©rez-Reverte
The best lie is the one that has an element of truth, so it's good to include something real in your fiction. - Renee Conoulty
Don't polish it forever, put it out there. At some point the changes aren't improvements, they're just changes. - Dan Alatorre
Writers get ideas all day every day. The FedEx guy delivers a package from Sears and the writer is thinking how it could actually be a ticking time bomb. - Dan Alatorre
We slip into a dream, forgetting the room we're sitting in, forgetting it's lunchtime or time to go to work. We recreate, with minor and for the most part unimportant changes, the vivid and continuous dream the writer worked out in his mind (revising and revising until he got it right) and captured in language so that other human beings, whenever they feel like it, may open his book and dream that dream again. - John Gardner
On working with other writers: You develop honesty and you can then ask the really embarrassing questions. I have learned so many things I didn't want to know, and they were all a result of interesting interviews for background information. - Dan Alatorre
My characters still talk the way normal people talk. They argue, they are sarcastic with each other, they joke around. I usually end up with one outrageous minor character in each book that people just rave about. We all have that one friend who says and does things that are a riot. A character like that is the salt in the soup: you want just enough to bring everything to life. - Dan Alatorre
Inspiration is the crÃ¨che of your brainchildren. If you don't feed them, they will die, and never come back. So someone please think about the children! - Kevin Focke
People are suckers for the truth and they know it when they see it. Open your soul and they will stop and watch. - Dan Alatorre
Dig deep and go where the pain and fear and joy are, and put it out there. The minute you shy away from pure honesty in your writing, you become a liar. - Dan Alatorre
Technical knowledge, divorced from what it is supposed to be knowledge of, yields only the illusion of understanding. It's like being able to reel off the locations in a baseball field -- first base, second base, third base, home plate, left field, right field, center field, pitcher's mound -- without having the slightest clue as to how they function in a game. You can talk the talk, but you can't walk the walk. - Stanley Fish, How to Write a Sentence: And How to Read One
The art of writing is the manipulation of words to ease the mind and free the imagination - Danielle M. Maistry
The invisibility factor of women in this industry is not unlike the invisibility of girl geeks. We know we exist, but everyone else seems to think we're an enigma every time they get the notion to write about us and what we apparently want. What we want isn't any different than what anyone wants. Good stories. With characters we can relate to or identify with or that are interesting to read about. And we'd like to feel welcome, not the perpetual other. We don't want to feel excluded or like props in every narrative. We don't want or need every story to be about a girl character. But we'd like them to be treated with the same care and attention male characters are. And it is possible, even in male dominated narratives. - Mariah Huehner, Whedonistas!: A Celebration of the Worlds of Joss Whedon by the Women Who Love Them
I'm my characters' galley slave. - Chloe Thurlow, The Fifty Shades of Grey Phenomena
the focus one finds in the grammar books is on the wrong forms, on forms detached from the underlying (or overarching) form that must be in place before any technical terms can be meaningful or alive - Stanley Fish, How to Write a Sentence: And How to Read One
Most people say, â€œShow, don't tell,â€ but I stand by Show and Tell, because when writers put their work out into the world, they're like kids bringing their broken unicorns and chewed-up teddy bears into class in the sad hope that someone else will love them as much as they do. - Colson Whitehead
For the writer, the process of writing a novel is like getting an advanced copy of a book you'd really like to read. - Brett Armstrong
A good writer reveals beauty in the mundane and truth in tragedy. Words are a tool; a currency of the mind, and the best writers weave passages into our hearts that our bones remember. - Maria Reeves
There is an underlying rhythm to all text. Sentences crashing fall like the waves of the sea, and work unconsciously on the reader. Punctuation is the music of language. As a conductor can influence the experience of the song by manipulating its rhythm, so can punctuation influence the reading experience, bring out the best (or worst) in a text. By controlling the speed of a text, punctuation dictates how it should be read. A delicate world of punctuation lives just beneath the surface of your work, like a world of microorganisms living in a pond. They are missed by the naked eye, but if you use a microscope you will find a exist, and that the pond is, in fact, teeming with life. This book will teach you to become sensitive to this habitat. The more you do, the greater the likelihood of your crafting a finer work in every respect. Conversely the more you turn a blind eye, the greater the likelihood of your creating a cacophonous text and of your being misread. - Noah Lukeman, A Dash of Style: The Art and Mastery of Punctuation
Voice is really about letting your characters loose. - C.S. Lakin, Writing the Heart of Your Story
The creative writer is compulsively concrete . . . . His fictional house should be haunted by ideas, not inhabited by them; they should flit past the windows after dark, not fill the rooms. The moment anyone tries to make poems or stories of ideas alone he is at the edge of absurdity; he can only harangue, never interest and persuade, because ideas in their conceptual state are simply not dramatic. They have to be put into the form of people and actions . . . - Wallace Stegner, On Teaching and Writing Fiction
In the minds of some people, writing is one thing, but thinking is quite another. If they define writing as spelling, the production of sentences with random meanings, and punctuation, then they might have a case. But who would accept such a definition? Writing is the production of meaning. Writing is thinking. - George Hillocks Jr.
Thousands of years ago, there were no writers; just storytellers. I would love to be a storyteller but I am just a writer. I don't appeal to the ears; I appeal to the mind. - King Samuel Benson
One of the key secrets of great writing is knowing where to start and when to stop. - Chloe Thurlow, The Fifty Shades of Grey Phenomena
How hard can writing be? After all, most of the words are going to be 'and,' 'the,' and 'I,' and 'it,' and so on, and there's a huge number to choose from, so a lot of the work has been done for you. - Terry Pratchett, Snuff
Bye-bye. Nice knowing you. But if you are waiting for that perfect idea to strike like lightning during a dust storm (I live in New Mexico), you could be waiting a long time. Ideas are everywhere. EVERYWHERE. I can't walk to the bathroom without being hit with another idea. It's what you DO with that idea that matters. Here is your mantra: BICHOK, BICHOK, BICHOKTranslation: Butt in chair, hands on keys. Just write. Every stinking day. - Darynda Jones
Verbose is not a synonym for literary. - Constance Hale, Sin and Syntax: How to Craft Wickedly Effective Prose
The reader is someone with an attention span of about 30 seconds. - William Zinsser, On Writing Well: The Classic Guide to Writing Nonfiction
When will someone write from the point of view of a joke, that is to say theway God sees events from above? - Gustave Flaubert
No writing is effortless. I'm not saying you can't have a good day where the words just kind of flow, but even those words have to be edited. Probably more than once. And I'm not saying a character hasn't somehow gone in a different direction that I wanted her to go, but that was me, not her. I let her get away from me. I let her roam free and nine times out of ten, the result is not good. I have to go back and start over because she veered off the path of my book. She changed the vision. And I did that. Not her. - Darynda Jones
From school desks with inkwells and scratchy nibs on paper to sweaty finger prints on a tablet... technology progression yes... style? - David H. Millar
When you sell a man a book you don't sell him just 12 ounces of paper and ink and glueâ€”you sell him a whole new life. - Christopher Morley
Any thing is interesting if you can communicate it. There are no unimportant subjects for the enlivened mind. - Kris Saknussemm
The best ending ever, for a science fiction book - or any novel, now that I think about it - was in Rendezvous With Rama. You know that you're at the end of the book and yet, there is no resolution. Then he hits you with those last six words. Better yet, the power is in the very last word. Wow! - John Gaver
The object of storytelling, like the object of magic, is not to explain or to resolve, but rather to create and to perform miracles of the imagination. To extend the boundaries of the mysterious. To push into the unknown in pursuit of still other unknowns. To reach into one's heart, down into that place where the stories are, bringing up the mystery of oneself. - Tim O'Brien
Sixteen unseeing stone of disheveled male slammed into her; Robin was knocked off her feet and catapulted backwards, handbag flying, arms windmilling, towards the void beyond the lethal staircase. - Robert Galbraith, The Cuckoo's Calling
...what draws us into a story and keeps us there is the firing of our dopamine neurons, signaling that intriguing information is on the way. - Lisa Cron, Wired for Story: The Writer's Guide to Using Brain Science to Hook Readers from the Very First Sentence
Screenplays are structure, and that's all they are. The quality of writingâ€”which is crucial in almost every other form of literatureâ€”is not what makes a screenplay work. Structure isn't anything else but telling the story, starting as late as possible, starting each scene as late as possible. You don't want to begin with â€œOnce upon a time,â€ because the audience gets antsy. - William Goldman
She asserted that the best fictional detail was a chosen detail, not a remembered one - for fictional truth was not only the truth of observation, which was the truth of mere journalism. The best fictional detail was the detail that should have defined the character or the episode or the atmosphere. Fictional truth was what should have happened in a story - not necessarily what did happen or what had happened. - John Irving, A Widow for One Year
T[he rules of writing] require that the episodes in a tale shall be necessary parts of the tale, and shall help to develop it. - Mark Twain, Fenimore Cooper's Literary Offenses
T[he rules of writing] require that the personages in a tale shall be alive, except in the case of corpses, and that always the reader shall be able to tell the corpses from the others. - Mark Twain, Fenimore Cooper's Literary Offenses
An idea for a story can be anything. The sky is not the limit, the limit is beyond it. - Chrys Fey
The difference between the right word and the almost right word is the difference between lightning and a lightning bug.â€• Mark Twain, The Wit and Wisdom of Mark Twain - Zan Marie Steadham
Look for the clutter in your writing and prune it ruthlessly. Be grateful for everything you can throw away. Reexamine each sentence you put on paper. Is every word doing new work? Can any thought be expressed with more economy? Is anything pompous or pretentious or faddish? Are you hanging on to something useless just because you think it's beautiful?...Simplify, simplify. - William Zinsser
Doing it all the time, whether or not we are in the mood, gives us ownership of our writing ability. It takes it out of the realm of conjuring where we stand on the rock of isolation, begging the winds for inspiration, and it makes it something as do-able as picking up a hammer and pounding a nail. Writing may be an art, but it is certainly a craft. It is a simple and workable thing that can be as steady and reliable as a choreâ€”does that ruin the romance? - Julia Cameron, The Right to Write: An Invitation and Initiation into the Writing Life
What you need to remember is that there's a difference between lecturing about what you know and using it to enrich the story. The latter is good. The former is not. - Stephen King, On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft
If any man wish to write in a clear style, let him be first clear in his thoughts. - Johann Wolfgang von Goethe
For the vision of a novelist is both complex and specialised; complex, because behind his characters and apart from them must stand something stable to which he relates them; specialised because since he is a single person with one sensibility the aspects of life in which he can believe with conviction are strictly limited - Virginia Woolf, The Common Reader
It can be said that one slip of point of view by a writer can hurt a story badly, and several slips can be fatal.' Stein on Writing - Sol Stein
What makes a writer successful is not money or fame (though both are nice) ... it's that in being true to her or himself, the words were able to connect to a reader's heart. - Miyoko Hikiji
Stories that pander to your every readerly desire and whim are like overly loyal dogs that live for the simple glow of your approval. I'm a cat person. I like a little aloofness in my pets and my writing. - Alden Bell, Exit Kingdom
Contrary to popular belief, people always say "It was a pleasure doing business with you". It is the only thing that has stayed with me after an assignment. Always mix business with pleasure. That is a secret they don't want you to know. BUT never mix pleasure with business. Then you might just end up in a divorce. - Nikhil Sharda
Doubt is the only reliable source of creativity. - Peter Tieryas, Watering Heaven
Every once in a bestseller list, you come across a truly exceptional craftsman, a wordsmith so adept at cutting, shaping, and honing strings of words that you find yourself holding your breath while those words pass from page to eye to brain. You know the feeling: you inhale, hold it, then slowly let it out, like one about to take down a bull moose with a Winchester .30-06. You force your mind to the task, scope out the area, take penetrating aim, and . . . read.But instead of dropping the quarry, you find you've become the hunted, the target. The projectile has somehow boomeranged and with its heat-sensing abilities (you have raised a sweat) darts straight towards you. Duck! And turn the page lest it drill between your eyes. - Chila Woychik, On Being a Rat and Other Observations
Poetry expands the senses and keeps them in prime condition. It keeps you aware of your nose, your eye, your ear, your tongue, your hand. - Ray Bradbury, Zen in the Art of Writing
A blank page is no empty space. It is brimming with potential... It is a masterpiece in waiting -- yours. - A.A. Patawaran, Write Here Write Now: Standing at Attention Before My Imaginary Style Dictator
All writers pen sad stories to garner sympathy, writing is after all for the abandoned of the society: the ink-leech, spewing black blood and sucking innocent souls. - Aporva Kala, Life... Love... Kumbh...
Writing is work. It's also gambling. You don't get a pension plan. Other people can help you a bit, but Â­essentially you're on your own. Â­Nobody is making you do this: you chose it, so don't whine. - Margaret Atwood
I don't just want a gripping story line. I shoot for the three dimensional literary Braille to a silent Scorsese movie - Carl Henegan, Darkness Left Undone

If grammar is the skeleton of expression and usage the flesh and blood, then style is the personality. - Arthur Plotnik, Elements of Expression
My imagination, unbidden, possessed and guided me, gifting the successive images that arose in my mind with a vivdness far beyond the usual bounds of reverie.... - Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley
...at seventeen I tried to write poetry confining myself solely to Anglo-Saxon words - don't know if it helped, but it made me more concrete ... - John Geddes, A Familiar Rain
Never place your punch at the beginning of a column nor at the end. Sneak it in where it's least expected. Fill a whole column with drivel, just to get in that one important line. - Ayn Rand, The Fountainhead
Inspiration can be a wonderful thing, but it can also be quite fickle ... If you want to be able to call on inspiration reliably then you need to work on it with regularity. Someone once said that if you only go out with a bucket to collect water when it's raining, sometimes you'll get water. But if you go out with your bucket every day, even when it's not raining, sometimes you'll catch unexpected rain. And also, a strange thing may happen: that the very act of going out with your bucket may actually provoke such rain. - Etienne de L'Amour, Time and Time Again
Writing is my oxygen. Music is my carbon dioxide. - Jessica Bell
This whole show vs tell concept both bewilders and challenges my mind. - Davee Jones
You are not an "author," you are a writer. If your books are still selling like hotcakes ten years after your demise, THEN you're an author. - H.P. Oliver
No matter how entertaining, diverse, concise, or detailed, a writing craft book is, it's not going to work magic on you, it's not going to suddenly make you a brilliant writer simply by reading it. You need to use what you read and learn in your own writing. Because that's when you have those AHA moments. That's when it really sticks. - Jessica Bell, Show & Tell in a Nutshell: Demonstrated Transitions from Telling to Showing
Find the problem, find the story. - John Brown
During 30 years of earning my daily bread as a writer I have learned many lessons about our craft. The most significant of those lessons is that I still have many lessons to learn about out craft. - H.P. Oliver
Writing is more than a craft -  it is a way of life. Everything you see or do becomes part of what you write.
I don't know if you have had the same experience, but the snag I always come up against when I'm telling a story is this dashed difficult problem of where to begin it. - P.G. Wodehouse, Right Ho, Jeeves
However great a man's natural talent may be, the act of writing cannot be learned all at once. - Jean-Jacques Rousseau
If you start to revise before you've reached the end, you're likely to begin dawdling with the revisions and putting off the difficult task of writing. - Pearl S. Buck
In my opinion it is not the writer's job to solve such problems as God, pessimism, etc; his job is merely to record who, under what conditions, said or thought what about God or pessimism. The artist is not meant to be a judge of his characters and what they say; his only job is to be an impartial witness. I heard two Russians in a muddled conversation about pessimism, a conversation that solved nothing; all I am bound to do is reproduce that conversation exactly as I heard it. Drawing conclusions is up to the jury, that is, the readers. My only job is to be talented, that is, to know how to distinguish important testimony from unimportant, to place my characters in the proper light and speak their language. - Anton Chekhov
You need a certain amount of nerve to be a writer. - Margaret Atwood
Meredith,' interposed Celia, 'makes one of his women, Emilia in England, say that poetry is like talking on tiptoe; like animals in cages, always going to one end and back again. - Harold Frederic, The Damnation of Theron Ware: Or Illumination
Telling a story is like playing a fiddle. No one want's to hear it when it's done badly - K.A.Young
Writing is a team sport. - Chris  White
It was not the privileged and the fortunate who took in the Jews in France. It was the marginal and damaged, which should remind us that there are real limits to what evil and misfortune can accomplish. If you take away the gift of reading, you create the gift of listening. If you bomb a city, you leave behind death and destruction. But you create a community of remote misses. If you take away a mother or a father, you cause suffering and despair. But one time in ten, out of that despair rises as indomitable force. You see the giant and the shepherd in the Valley of Elah and your eye is drawn to the man with sword and shield and the glittering armor. But so much of what is beautiful and valuable in the world comes from the shepherd, who has more strength and purpose than we ever imagine. - Malcolm Gladwell, David and Goliath: Underdogs, Misfits, and the Art of Battling Giants

Say what you want but you NEVER say it with violence! - Gerard Way

Protest is when I say I don't like this. Resistance is when I put an end to what I don't like. Protest is when I say I refuse to go along with this anymore. Resistance is when I make sure everybody else stops going along too. - Ulrike Marie Meinhof
I for one believe that if you give people a thorough understanding of what confronts them and the basic causes that produce it, they'll create their own program, and when the people create a program, you get action. - Malcolm X
I learned early that crying out in protest could accomplish things. My older brothers and sister had started to school when, sometimes, they would come in and ask for a buttered biscuit or something and my mother, impatiently, would tell them no. But I would cry out and make a fuss until I got what I wanted. I remember well how my mother asked me why I couldn't be a nice boy like Wilfred; but I would think to myself that Wilfred, for being so nice and quiet, often stayed hungry. So early in life, I had learned that if you want something, you had better make some noise. - Malcolm X, The Autobiography of Malcolm X
I will act now. I will act now. I will act now. Henceforth, I will repeat these words each hour, each day, everyday, until the words become as much a habit as my breathing, and the action which follows becomes as instinctive as the blinking of my eyelids. With these words I can condition my mind to perform every action necessary for my success. I will act now. I will repeat these words again and again and again. I will walk where failures fear to walk. I will work when failures seek rest. I will act now for now is all I have. Tomorrow is the day reserved for the labor of the lazy. I am not lazy. Tomorrow is the day when the failure will succeed. I am not a failure. I will act now. Success will not wait. If I delay, success will become wed to another and lost to me forever. This is the time. This is the place. I am the person. - Og Mandino
When principles that run against your deepest convictions begin to win the day, then battle is your calling, and peace has become sin; you must, at the price of dearest peace, lay your convictions bare before friend and enemy, with all the fire of your faith. - Abraham Kuyper
Every day I get better at knowing that it is not a choice to be an activist; rather, it is the only way to hold on to the better parts of my human self. It is the only way I can live and laugh without guilt. - Staceyann Chin

What lies between where you are and where you want to be sometimes requires traveling through the Twilight Zone. - Shannon L. Alder
As you get to thirty, the main thing is to not be sensible. - Mark Steel
[W]hat possible purpose does this lashing-out serve? Will activists be shamed into recovering their previous enthusiasm? Will Republicans stop their vicious attacks because Obama is lashing out to his left? It was pure self-indulgence; even if he feels aggrieved, he has to judge his words by their usefulness, not by his desire to vent. This isn't about him. - Paul Krugman
To engage in activism that envisions alternatives ways of organizing society and alternative ways of being is to risk membership in society, a sense of belonging, however partial it may be. Activism can make us vulnerable because it is so obviously about wanting something beyond what is, and to have a political desire often is construed as wanting too much. - Deborah B. Gould, Moving Politics: Emotion and ACT UP's Fight against AIDS
We felt as though we had a responsibility to do something about it. So, we did. - Xiuhtezcatl Martinez, We Rise: The Earth Guardians Guide to Building a Movement that Restores the Planet
Where there is poverty, there will be destruction and exploitation by the corporations and governments benefitting from destroying our rainforests and trafficking wildlife.ï»¿ - Eileen Anglin
When, thirty-five years ago, I tried to give a summary of the ideas and principles of that social philosophy that was once known under the name of liberalism, I did not indulge in the vain hope that my account would prevent the impending catastrophes to which the policies adopted by the European nations were manifestly leading. All I wanted to achieve was to offer to the small minority of thoughtful people an opportunity to learn something about the aims of classical liberalism and its achievements and thus to pave the way for a resurrection of the spirit of freedom after the coming debacle. - Ludwig von Mises, Liberalism
If you're not angry, you're either a stone, or you're too sick to be angry. You should be angry. You must not be bitter. Bitterness is like cancer. It eats upon the host. It doesn't do anything to the object of its displeasure. So use that anger, yes. You write it. You paint it. You dance it. You march it. You vote it. You do everything about it. You talk it. Never stop talking it. - Maya Angelou
I do what I can,' I said. 'When I can do more, I will. You know that. - Octavia E. Butler, Parable of the Talents
It's not an effective protest if it's not pissing people off. - John Scalzi, Lock In
Don't be a witness. Be an activist. - DaShanne Stokes
A study of the San Francisco Beat enclave by psychiatrist Dr. Francis Rigney in the late 1950's showed 60 percent "were so psychotic or crippled by tensions, anxiety and neurosis as to be nonfunctional in the competitive world." In contrast, the several studies released so far made of the student radicals at Berkeley show them to be stable, serious, and of above-average intelligence. The point is that the Beats had to "cop out" of the Rat Race because they couldn't perform; the New Left chooses to reject a society it could easily be successful in. - Jack Newfield
I really admire people in the public eye, who have influence or celebrity and they take a stand on something important, bring awareness and take compassionate action.When you have been blessed with abundance or are an influencer and you bring attention to a cause, or do something to help the world, that's using your blessings for the greater good. Those are the people who inspire me. - Eileen Anglin
This is the world as it is. This is where you start. - Saul D. Alinsky
16 days of activism? I don't know about you folks, but I'm an activist every single day. - Christina Engela, All That Remains
I remember the philosopher Bertrand Russell was asked why he spent his time protesting against nuclear war and getting arrested on demonstrations. Why didn't he continue to work on the serious philosophical and logical problems which have major intellectual significance? And his answer was pretty good. He said: â€œLook, if I and others like me only work on those problems, there won't be anybody around to appreciate it or be interested. - Chomsky Noam
I was born for this moment in Earth's history and if you believe you are a lightworker, so were you. - Eileen Anglin
As far as we could tell, the face of the revolution was a sea of embroidering women, patiently waiting the resignation of their repressive governor. - Diana Denham
We are the vanguard of our times. What we do in our lifetimes will set the future of all beings. The loving, conscious choices you make for yourself will effect the future of life and of souls uncounted. This is how important you are. And this is how important loving yourself and living your best life is. - Eileen Anglin
Extract and expel implicit biases from your work life. Don't taint our visitors with your bias and views. Allow them to form their own conclusions where it's developmentally appropriate. - Monica O Montgomery
We are beginning to understand that the world is always being made fresh and never finished; that activism can be the journey rather than the arrival; that's struggle doesn't always have to be confrontational but can take the form of reaching out to find common ground with the many others in our society who are also seeking ways out from alienation, isolation, privatization, and dehumanization by corporate globalization. - Grace Lee Boggs, The Next American Revolution: Sustainable Activism for the Twenty-First Century
Voices joined together for a cause are like a wave that changes the shore. - Eileen Anglin
Still, it becomes clearer every day that organizing or joining massive protests and demanding new policies fail to sufficiently address the crisis we face. They may demonstrate that we are on the right side politically, but they are not transformative enough. They do not change the cultural images or the symbols that play such a pivotal role in molding us into who we are. - Grace Lee Boggs, The Next American Revolution: Sustainable Activism for the Twenty-First Century
The physical threat posed by climate change represents a crisis that is not only material but also profoundly spiritual at its core because it challenges us to think seriously about the future of the human race and what it means to be a human being. - Grace Lee Boggs, The Next American Revolution: Sustainable Activism for the Twenty-First Century
Every crisis, actual or impending, needs to be viewed as an opportunity to bring about profound changes in our society. Going beyond protest organizing, visionary organizing begins by creating images and stories of the future that help us imagine and create alternatives to the existing system. - Grace Lee Boggs, The Next American Revolution: Sustainable Activism for the Twenty-First Century
A single whisper can be quite a disturbance when the rest of the audience is silent. - Anthony Marra, The Tsar of Love and Techno
You never do any good until you get into some trouble. - Arthur Miller
There is nothing like the whites of someone's eyes to convince you how very true what you believe is, how very much you must act on it. - Jennine Capo Crucet, Make Your Home Among Strangers
We are the dead . Our only true life is in the future. We shall take part in it as handfuls of dust and splinters of bone. - George Orwell, 1984
But if you sit around thinking what to do and end up not doing anything, why bother even thinking about it? You're better off going out on the town and having a good time. No, we have to think and act. That's what we're doing here, and that's what you have to do. - Elvia Alvarado, Don't Be Afraid, Gringo
There is no politically neutral fence available for us to sit on, and our attempts to do so have the consequence (intended or not) of supporting the existing political system. - Anne Kearney, Counselling, Class and Politics: Undeclared Influences in Therapy
I'm fighting now only for individual captive dolphins and dolphins in general but also for people, for the mind and sensibilities of future generations toward the world itself. - Richard O'Barry, To Free a Dolphin
Or perhaps it's "activist," but on environmental and economic problems, without understanding that pressuring women to have too many children is the biggest cause of environmental distress, and economic courses should start with reproduction, not just production. - Gloria Steinem, My Life on the Road
Reuse is the original green collar job. - MaryEllen Etienne
We can't achieve zero waste without reuse. - MaryEllen Etienne
I have no interest in eliminating the tension between justice and forgiveness by taking justice off the table. Given the subtleties of sin and the persistence of evil, we would soon be living in moral anarchy and political chaos if there were no provision for justice. - Eugene H. Peterson, Tell It Slant: A Conversation on the Language of Jesus in His Stories and Prayers
Why is it that the people who seem to have the most to say aren't doing anything at all? - Colleen Patrick-Goudreau, Vegan's Daily Companion: 365 Days of Inspiration for Cooking, Eating, and Living Compassionately
Do what you can, when you can. - Johnny Worthen, The Brand Demand
There is a stereotype that vegans talk about being vegan all the time. The irony is, once people find out I'm vegan, I quickly become their confessor, counselor, and sounding board. - Colleen Patrick-Goudreau, Vegan's Daily Companion: 365 Days of Inspiration for Cooking, Eating, and Living Compassionately
People will love him (Theodore Roosevelt) for the enemies he has made. - Doris Kearns Goodwin, The Bully Pulpit: Theodore Roosevelt, William Howard Taft, and the Golden Age of Journalism
I really admired Cesar Chavez and Gandhi, but my form of activism would have to be the written word, not the empty stomach. My parents had brought my family t the United States because of the fear of empty stomachs. - Josefina LÃ³pez, Hungry Woman in Paris
Lincoln on Grant: "He makes things get. Wherever he is, he makes things move. - Abraham Lincoln
A truly living human being cannot remain neutral. - Nadine Gordimer, The Quotable Gordimer; or, The Wit and Wisdom of Nadine Gordimer

I'm for truth, no matter who tells it. I'm for justice, no matter who is for or against it. - Malcolm X
No genuine change in society ever occurs without the mass public getting behind a cause. The good guys in government are counting on enough of us common people waking up and demanding more rights and greater freedoms. - James Morcan, The Orphan Conspiracies: 29 Conspiracy Theories from The Orphan Trilogy
I guess it's the curse of our generation, having to put aside our lives to do the right thing. - Allan Dare Pearce, Paris in April
To crank up a noisy bad stance out in a place like San Francisco and start yelling about â€œgetting things done in Washingtonâ€ is like sitting far back in the end zone seats at the Super Bowl and screaming at the Miami linebackers â€œStop Duane Thomas! - Hunter S. Thompson, Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail '72
In the case of Tunisia, it was indeed this single act that sparked what had been long-standing active protest movements and moved them forward. But that's not so unusual. Let's look at our own history. Take the civil rights movement. There had been plenty of concern and activism about violent repression of blacks in the South, and it took a couple of students sitting in at a lunch counter to really set it off. Small acts can make a big difference when there is a background of concern, understanding, and preliminary activism. - Noam Chomsky, Power Systems: Conversations on Global Democratic Uprisings and the New Challenges to U.S. Empire
"Why do you live out here? You're a great healer; you could get work in the inner city if you wanted to. Even in E-star, I bet."" 	""Well, I just don't want to live anywhere else,"" She looked up, smiling so that the lines at the edges of her eyes crinkled. As she looked out into the expanse of endless desert that led up to the crater wall, she seemed as though her thoughts were far away. ""This place is our home. It was my mother's home, and her mother's before that. This is what we know, and even though our lives aren't as long as those with the clean air... this is our land. - Hazel Blackthorn, His Brother's Keeper"
We survive on adversity and perish in ease and comfort. - Livy
Nobody can possibly be so hungry that they need to take a life in order to feel satisfied - they don't after all, take a human life, so why take the life of an animal? Both are conscious beings with the same determination to survive. It is habit, and laziness and nothing else. - Morrissey, Autobiography
The enemy was not the Klan but the inside-outside lock that racism and classism had on the minds of the people: It operated from the inside through self-hate and self-doubt, and from the outside through the police, carnivorous landlords, and the welfare system. - Junius Williams, Unfinished Agenda: Urban Politics in the Era of Black Power
If not you, who? If not now, when? The worst thing well-meaning people can do is simply let things remain as they are. - Christine Pope, The Mandala Maneuver
There is no way to tell if we are the pioneers of a visionary new age, whisking humanity into the high vibrations of an interdimensional love party, or post-modern Don Quixotes attacking techno-industrial windmills with our flimsy, rolled-up yoga mats. - Jonathan Talat Phillips, The Electric Jesus: The Healing Journey of a Contemporary Gnostic
I detect the activist returning with a vengence. - E.A. Bucchianeri, Brushstrokes of a Gadfly
Our ailing planet needs spiritual warriors, ones capable of standing up to the Western materialism machine, so we can create sustainable societies that care for their citizens, harmonize with the cycles of nature, and receive and honor the vast healing light that quietly connects us all. - Jonathan Talat Phillips, The Electric Jesus: The Healing Journey of a Contemporary Gnostic
We need to stop fighting the old systems and start creating new containers for people who are going through these spiritual openings,' Tavis reflected. â€˜Together, we need to build something that's never existed beforeâ€”a global network of light. - Jonathan Talat Phillips, The Electric Jesus: The Healing Journey of a Contemporary Gnostic
Could it be that following our initiatory path and connecting with higher source wisdom might actually be one of our species' best defense systems? - Jonathan Talat Phillips, The Electric Jesus: The Healing Journey of a Contemporary Gnostic
Why build entirely new systems for connecting to Christ consciousness when the institutionsâ€”whether Methodist, Lutheran, or Baptistâ€”have already been created? - Jonathan Talat Phillips, The Electric Jesus: The Healing Journey of a Contemporary Gnostic

I don't get it. I just don't get it. If Art is supposed to imitate Life, why do they want all the actors to be thin? There are fat people in the world. Shouldn't there be a few of us actors to represent them? - Camryn Manheim, Wake Up, I'm Fat!
Wrong is an addictive, repetitive story; Right is where the movement is. - Paul Hawken, Blessed Unrest: How the Largest Movement in the World Came into Being and Why No One Saw It Coming

If you look at the science that describes what is happening on earth today and aren't pessimistic, you don't have the correct data. If you meet people in this unnamed movement and aren't optimistic, you haven't got a heart. - Paul Hawken, Blessed Unrest: How the Largest Movement in the World Came into Being and Why No One Saw It Coming
We need to consume less. A lot less. Less food, less energy, less stuff. Fewer cars, electric cars, cotton T-shirts, laptops, mobile phone upgrades. Far fewer.Yet, every decade, global consumption continues to increase relentlessly. - Stephen Emmott, Ten Billion
I think the church is often a culprit in the busyness, especially in the evangelical church. Again, it's part of being Americans. Part of being evangelicals too is that we're highly activist. We are always diving in, willing to solve problems, and again there's a lot good there. But we also need the theological balance that the Kingdom is not ours to bring or ours to create. - Kevin DeYoung
If my activism, however well-motivated, drives out love, then I have misunderstood Jesus' gospel. I am stuck with law, not the gospel of grace. - Philip Yancey
Action comes from keeping the heat on. No politician can sit on a hot issue if you make it hot enough. - Saul D. Alinsky, Rules for Radicals: A Pragmatic Primer for Realistic Radicals

We cannot do everything, but we can all do something. - Dillon Burroughs, Activist Faith: From Him and For Him

All that existed was Jace; all she felt, hoped, breathed, wanted, and saw was Jace. Nothing else mattered. - Cassandra Clare, City of Glass
This connection we have isn't going away, it's only getting stronger. Because the more I spend time with her, the closer I want to be. - Simone Elkeles, Perfect Chemistry
If you have to speculate if someone loves you and wants to be with you, chances are they don't. It's not that complicated. Love, in most cases, betrays the one feeling it. Don't waste moments waiting and wondering. Don't throw away your time dreaming of someone that doesn't want you. No one is that amazing, certainly not the one who would pass you up. - Donna Lynn Hope
I wanted to see you again, touch you, know who you were, see if I would find you identical with the ideal image of you which had remained with me and perhaps shatter my dream with the aid of reality.-Claude Frollo  - Victor Hugo, The Hunchback of Notre Dame
This isn't a crush, it's obsession.You are never not in my thoughts. Your scent carries across a room and paralyzes me with longing. I don't want to hold your hand. Part of me wants to set you on fire and hold you while the flame consumes us both, to eat your heart so I know that only I possess it entirely. - Gwen Hayes, Falling Under
From the first time I saw you, I've belonged to you completely. I still do. If you want me. -Jace - Cassandra Clare, City of Glass
It's not like love at first sight, really. It's more likeâ€¦ gravity moves. When you see her, suddenly it's not the earth holding you here anymore. She does. And nothing matters more than her. And you would do anything for her, be anything for herâ€¦ You become whatever she needs you to be, whether that's a protector, or a lover, or a friend, or a brother. - Stephenie Meyer, Eclipse
Mujer, you own my soul. - Simone Elkeles, Perfect Chemistry
Never in my life had I been more frustrated. Go figure it wouldn't be with a human but a freaking alien. At least I now knew that the male species were asses no matter what planet they hailed from. - Jennifer L. Armentrout, Obsession
All right, you caught me. I'm secretly obsessed with you and spend all my free time writing about you in my journal. 'Dear Diary, today Will was an ass for the 467th day in a row. He's so dreamy - Elizabeth Scott, Perfect You
My whole life was about her, what if her whole life wasn't all about me? - Jodi Picoult, The Pact
Why should I blame her that she filled my daysWith misery, or that she would of late Have taught to ignorant men most violent ways,Or hurled the little streets upon the great, Had they but courage equal to desire?What could have made her peaceful with a mindThat nobleness made simple as a fire,With beauty like a tightened bow, a kindThat is not natural in an age like thisBeing high and solitary and most stern?Why, what could she have done, being what she is?Was there another Troy for her to burn? - W.B. Yeats, The Collected Poems of W.B. Yeats
The outside world holds no interest for me without you." -Edward - Stephenie Meyer, Eclipse
That's the thing about success and happiness. Every time I fall in love I become absolutely, pathologically obsessed. The moment that you have what you want, and you're not totally ready for it, you become obsessed with the idea that you don't deserve it. - Sara Quin
...an obsession is a way for damaged people to damage themselves more. - Mark Barrowcliffe, The Elfish Gene: Dungeons, Dragons And Growing Up Strange
He really would have done all that for her, you see, and done it believing he'd burn in hell forever for doing it. He hadn't done it, and wouldn't had made her his anyway, but you see why he'd have figured it did. Or maybe I saw it anyway, at the time. He was a maniac and a monster, but people don't love like that anymore. Or maybe it's only the maniacs and monsters who do. I don't know.  - Peter S. Beagle, Tamsin
and I looked and looked at her, and knew as clearly as I know I am to die, that I loved her more than anything I had ever seen or imagined on earth, or hoped for anywhere else. She was only the faint violet whiff and dead leaf echo of the nymphet I had rolled myself upon with such cries in the past; an echo on the brink of a russet ravine, with a far wood under a white sky, and brown leaves choking the brook, and one last cricket in the crisp weeds... but thank God it was not that echo alone that I worshipped. What I used to pamper among the tangled vines of my heart, mon grand pch radieux, had dwindled to its essence: sterile and selfish vice, all that I cancelled and cursed. You may jeer at me, and threaten to clear the court, but until I am gagged and halfthrottled, I will shout my poor truth. I insist the world know how much I loved my Lolita, this Lolita, pale and polluted, and big with another's child, but still gray-eyed, still sooty-lashed, still auburn and almond, still Carmencita, still mine; Changeons de vie, ma Carmen, allons vivre quelque, part o nous ne serons jamais spars; Ohio? The wilds of Massachusetts? No matter, even if those eyes of hers would fade to myopic fish, and her nipples swell and crack, and her lovely young velvety delicate delta be tainted and torneven then I would go mad with tenderness at the mere sight of your dear wan face, at the mere sound of your raucous young voice, my Lolita. - Vladimir Nabokov, Lolita
Is it love, obsession, infatuation? You don't know. You think of a strange and beautiful word you read about once, Limerance, a psychological term, meaning an obsessive love, a state that's almost like a drug. Need like a wolf paces the perimeter of your world, back and forth, back and forth, never letting up. ...You're appalled by the new appetites within you, kicking their feet and clawing to get out. - Nikki Gemmell
There is practically no activity that cannot be enhanced or replaced by knitting, if you really want to get obsessive about it. - Stephanie Pearl-McPhee, At Knit's End: Meditations for Women Who Knit Too Much
All good research-whether for science or for a book-is a form of obsession. - Mary Roach
To muse for long unwearied hours with my attention riveted to some frivolous device upon the margin, or in the typography of a book â€” to become absorbed for the better part of a summer's day in a quaint shadow falling aslant upon the tapestry, or upon the floor â€” to lose myself for an entire night in watching the steady flame of a lamp, or the embers of a fire â€” to dream away whole days over the perfume of a flower â€” to repeat monotonously some common word, until the sound, by dint of frequent repetition, ceased to convey any idea whatever to the mind â€” to lose all sense of motion or physical existence in a state of absolute bodily quiescence long and obstinately persevered in â€” Such were a few of the most common and least pernicious vagaries induced by a condition of the mental faculties, not, indeed, altogether unparalleled, but certainly bidding defiance to any thing like analysis or explanation. - Edgar Allan Poe, Berenice
Mine first --mine last-- mine even in the grave! - Louisa May Alcott
It's similar to the way you feel cuddling an infant or a kitten, when you want to squeeze it so hard you'd kill it... - ZoÃ« Heller, What Was She Thinking? [Notes on a Scandal]
i discovered that my obsession for having each thing in the right place, each subject at the right time, each word in the right style, was not the well-deserved reward of an ordered mind, but just the opposite: a complete system of pretense invented by me to hide the disorder of my nature. - Gabriel GarcÃ­a MÃ¡rquez
You fueled my obession, even encouraged it and your selfishness ruined my life - Novala Takemoto, Missin' (Novel)
I don't believe outstandingly beautiful and charismatic women create obsession in what would otherwise be normal men, but rather they attract the weirdos and the stalkers; flames in the darkness that these disturbing people inhabit, unwittingly drawing them closer until they extinguish the very flame they were drawn to. - Rosamund Lupton, Sister
All men are, at times, influenced by inexplicable sentiments. Ideas haunt them in spite of all their efforts to discard them. Prepossessions are entertained, for which their reason is unable to discover any adequate cause. The strength of a belief, when it is destitute of any rational foundation, seems, of itself, to furnish a new ground for credulity. We first admit a powerful persuasion, and then, from reflecting on the insufficiency of the ground on which it is built, instead of being prompted to dismiss it, we become more forcibly attached to it. - Charles Brockden Brown, Somnambulism And Other Stories
When two people love each other as we do, no one can come between them, no one," I said, amazed at the words I was uttering without preparation. "Lovers like us, because they know that nothing can destroy their love, even on the worst days, even when they are heedlessly hurting each other in the cruelest , most deceitful ways, still carry in their hearts a consolation that never abandons them." (p.191) - Orhan Pamuk, The Museum of Innocence
Nobody's bought this land. And no one's going to want it either. It's dying land, lonely land.""Like me, then," I said."Yes, like you." You chewed the corner of your lip. "You both need saving. - Lucy Christopher
And people with obsessions, reflected Bond, were blind to danger. - Ian Fleming, Moonraker
Obession makes everything possible - Novala Takemoto, Missin' (Novel)
It's all you think about, all you talk about, and all you want us to talk about. What in the world would we call something like that? Oh, yeah! An obsession! - Maggie Stiefvater, Shiver
I began to understand that the most worthwhile obsession is an obsession that is actually independent of the object of fixation. The object is only borrowed as a pretext, a means, an environment, through which or in which the obsessed person can project his own eternal and essential hunger, thus fulfilling the requirements of death--the dissolution of the ego for something, anything, that exists independently outside of one's self. Perhaps that obsession should be controlled. At some point the most mundane catalyst, a skirt or fallen leaf, is enough to provoke a series of captivating chain reactions, while at another time much more important objects will inspire only an absurd indifference. - Pháº¡m Thá»‹ HoÃ i
But it is easy to call a man in love a mad man. - Brendan Connell, Metrophilias
You've invaded my mind and I can't get you out of it," he accused with discernible disdain. She avoided looking at him and said, "Then you should forget." "Forget?" he thundered,"EVERYTHING reminds me of you!" She turned to confront him, slowing lifting her eyes to meet the disgust in his. "That's not my doing," she countered, "That's your doing and you are the only one who can control it. - Donna Lynn Hope
Recognize the signs, these perpetual question and need to control. Never be a part of someone else's obsession. Let them carry it alone, with their snakeskin smile. These are the people that hold their hand out and it's as cold as their heart. - Ron Baratono
When others' obsessions are not ours, we are sad for them, and we talk of how empty their lives will be if they don't achieve their empty goal: the gymnastics prize, the firm partnership. But there is a monomania in which it is the focus, the sense of transport, that is the real pleasure. - Alice W. Flaherty, The Midnight Disease: The Drive to Write, Writer's Block, and the Creative Brain
It was as if I were an oyster and somebody forced a grain of sand into my shell -- a grain of sand that I didn't know was there and didn't particularly welcome. Then a pearl started forming around the grain and it irritated me, made me angry, tortured me sometimes. But the oyster can't help becoming obsessed with the pearl. - Truman Capote
It's hard to explain how an infatuation actually starts. It's a state so all-encompassing that it's almost impossible to remember how it felt to live inside your own head before it began. Everything that precedes it becomes a pathway that was always leading there. Time before is valuable only as a resource with which to create a persona, to bind the object of the infatuation closer. I had given my (partially fabricated) past life to Mizuko to make a story that in the end never got told. Or not by her. It is also hard to explain the intensity of the infatuation itself. There is rarely an explanation that seems reasonable to anyone but you. Unless you're part of a cult or viral phenomenon, so that when you weep outside the object of your infatuation's hotel room, you do so in the company of millions. - Olivia Sudjic, Sympathy
An obsession is where something will not leave your mind - Eric Clapton
All these men who loved Emma, I think. For all her problems, men were fixated on her. Will anyone ever feel like that about me? - J.P. Delaney, The Girl Before

Meeting Hettie again made him achingly conscious once more of the irrefutable nature of his obsession with her. Obsession - or love? Or was it something more unhealthy - a kind of craving, an addiction? - William Boyd
Love? I wanted to go with him, to be on the stronger side, for him to spare me, like one who seeks shelter in the arms of the enemy to stay far from his arrows. It was different than love, I was finding out: I wanted him as a thirsty person desires water, without feelings, without even wanting to be happy. - Clarice Lispector, The Complete Stories
If it werenâ€˜t for Aspergerâ€˜s and obsessions there would be no Theory of Relativity, no Magic Flute, no Microsoftâ€¦and no Ghost Busters. - Rudy Simone, Aspergirls: Empowering Females with Asperger Syndrome
Lolita, light of my life, fire of my loins.My sin, my soul. - Vladimir Nabokov
Over and over I played her favorite Arvo PÃ¤rt, as a way of being with her; and she had only to mention recently read novel for me to grab it up hungrily, to be inside her thoughts, a sort of telepathy - Donna Tartt, The Goldfinch

They know too well the violent hypnosis of those who hope to possess them-- men who can smell the blood on the places where a woman is breaking. - Alana Massey, All the Lives I Want: Essays About My Best Friends Who Happen to Be Famous Strangers
We should bear in mind the supercrip stereotype as a figure obsessively, indeed maniacally, over-compensating for a perceived physical difference or lack, since, as we shall see, this aspect ties in quite neatly with the genre specificities and narratival concerns of so much Silver Age superhero literature. - JosÃ© Alaniz, Death, Disability, and the Superhero: The Silver Age and Beyond
See? Reading you all night has strengthened me. That's what God's love does. If you're beginning to feel uncomfortable now, it's because the changes in you are already beginning to happen and one day you'll be glad to say, Deliver me from meaninglessness. - Ian McEwan, Enduring Love
They were just boys. Take away the band, the lights, the fame, and the screaming girls, and they were just boys, chosen for us to obsess over. - Goldy Moldavsky, Kill the Boy Band
... I fell in love with him even more, because I realized I was not just falling in love with Taymour but also with generations of him that connect through history, traits that had been passed down from one generation to the next. I was in love with his ancestry that stretched out for centuries. - Saleem Haddad
Obsessive love is built on a tissue of illusions: that by having sex with someone you can possess that person's soul; that you can transmute past defeats into present triumphs without understanding or mourning; that you make the unloving love you by constancy, uncomplaining availability, and molding yourself into what you thing that person wants. - Jeanne Safer, The Golden Condom: And Other Essays on Love Lost and Found
He talked about her in a way that only the obsessed do. It was always a pressured monologue, and it was always the same. He had to relate every detail, interpreting and seeking meaning in her every utterance or action, like a fundamentalist minutely analyzing a biblical text. - Jeanne Safer, The Golden Condom: And Other Essays on Love Lost and Found
Some never escape from the imprisoning conviction that a cold or unattainable lover can be persuaded to become warm or attainable if they only discover the key. - Jeanne Safer, The Golden Condom: And Other Essays on Love Lost and Found

But she just couldn't stop checking her phone; she wantedto stop, tried to stop, but the pull would not let her go. It wasa strange experience for her to be doing the obsessive phone-checkingthing. Vanessa talked about it, and she had heard storiesabout it from other friends. One date with a guy and suddenlythe phone becomes like an appendage endowed with some superpower to predict your future. - Jacqueline Simon Gunn, Circle of Betrayal
I wonder if whoever invented World of Warcraft realizes it's practice for sociopaths. - Lisa Scottoline, Every Fifteen Minutes
I was obsessed. I couldn't stop myself. It was not healthy, but I couldn't stop. I didn't feel like there was anything else in my life to stop for. We all have periods of our life when we're trapped doing something we hate and we develop habits that have nothing to do with our long-term goals to fill the downtime, right? I hope you identify with that idea. It's the only way I can explain becoming so emotionally invested in a video game that I would get in my car and drive around town sobbing if my internet went out. - Felicia Day, You're Never Weird on the Internet
"Follow the ideal doing,grind the beans just before brewing.Use spring water,for softened water,makes a horror.A parley perfect,between the coffee,and the milk,with some,	brown sugar thick.â€ (Poem: An apology of a coffee lunatic, Book: Ginger and Honey) - Jasleen Kaur Gumber, Ginger and Honey"

Lane, I will become attached to you. It happens with everyone. Something about my personality makes me latch on to people. First, it was my friend Tina, then Liam, and now you.

I seemed to have lost all soul or sensation but for this one pursuit. - Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley, Frankenstein
The pleasure I found in reading books was disconcerting...I felt anxious about every new piece of information. I would latch onto one particular detail and start look for references and other versions of it in other writings. I remembered, for example, that for quite some time I tracked down the subject of kissing. I read and read and felt dizzy with the subject, as if I had eaten a psychotropic fruit. - Hassan Blasim, The Iraqi Christ
It was as if I had only just been able to see colours and shapes for the first time. I was so enthralled with the buttons on Lestat's black coat that I looked at nothing else for a long time. - Anne Rice, Interview with the Vampire
Nothing and no one had ever belonged to him and only himâ€”except Legion. Not that she would do anything necessary to save him, nor would he do anything necessary to save her. But. Yeah, there was always a but with him. He had been her first loverâ€”and he wanted to be her last. - Gena Showalter, The Darkest Seduction
In recent months, the emotional aspect has become as necessary to me as the physical. It amuses me, this strange quirk of mine. I want my little captive to love me, to care about me. I want to be more than just the monster of her nightmares. - Anna Zaires, Keep Me
I worry about you. You're good with people, I've seen it. You like them. But there's a limit for you.â€ He opened his mouth to protest but she held up her hand to silence him. â€œI know. You do care. But inside the framework of a project. Right now it's your studies. Later it'll be roads and bridges. But people around youâ€”their lives go on outside the framework. They're not just tools to your hand, even likable tools. Your life should go on, too. You should have more than roads to live for. Because if something does go wrong, you'll need what you're feeling to matter, to someone somewhere, anyway. - Kij Johnson, The Man Who Bridged the Mist
Don't be so obsessed with stardom that you miss out on success - Rasheed Ogunlaru

She came downstairs like a doe stepping into a clearing on the first day of hunting season. I felt like a coward. I was lower than dirt. I had used every trick in my book to get her to come downstairs. I had manipulated her emotions, cheated and wormed to beat her at this game we were playing. But then I saw her, and I was so happy. I knew I would have burned the building down for the sight of her running toward me out of the flames. - Candice Raquel Lee, The Innocent: A Myth
Certainly, it is more reasonable to devote one's life to women than to postage stamps, old snuff-boxes, or even to paintings and statues. - Marcel Proust, The Guermantes Way
I needed them, sure, and we can all argue about the moment when the balance tipped and I needed them so much that I would hurt. But you can't pretend they didn't need me too, each in his or her way. They wouldn't necessarily have admitted it - except Reza - but you can't tell me they didn't love me. The heart knows. The body knows. When I was with Sirena, or Reza, or Skandar, the air moved differently between us; time passed differently; words or gestures meant more than themselves. If you've never had this experience-but who has not been visited by love, laughing?-then you can't understand. And if you have, you don't need me to say another word. - Claire Messud, The Woman Upstairs
If someone even mentions his name it is like a little present to me - and I long to mention it myself. I start subjects leading up to it, and then I feel myself going red. I keep swearing to myself not to speak to him again - and then an opportunity occurs and I jump at it! - Dodie Smith, I Capture the Castle
One night, we somehow ended up discussing Wile E. Coyote as a paradigm for obsession. She argued that Wile E., with all the resources he wasted on gadgets, could have been living high on the hog.â€œHe was so skinny,â€ she complained after she had Googled him and watched a few skits on YouTube. â€œPoor thing, he looks like a size-zero model.â€â€œBut, Love, no other food would have satisfied him. He only wanted the Road Runner. He was obsessed with her. Obsession does not allow for satisfaction. You can never really eat your cake and have it too, which is the only way you can satisfy your obsession by devouring and yet having the object of your fascination,â€ I said from experience.â€œBut he really didn't want to catch it,â€ she argued.â€œWhat do you mean?â€â€œIt was the chase he wanted. To eat the Road Runner would have ended that, ended his only reason for living. He isn't really that inept. He really didn't want to catch it.â€â€œI guess not,â€ I said, thoughtfully. â€œIt's the journey not the resolution that matters. If he caught her, he would lie down next to her and die too. - Candice Raquel Lee, The Innocent: A Myth

Obsession is hard work and can only be performed at full speed for short periods of time. - Raymond L. Atkins, The Front Porch Prophet
Sylvia Plath is there for me when actual living people upon who I have depended upon my whole life, are not. What I mean to say is, without her words, I'd be exponentially more messed up than I am already. - Arlaina Tibensky, And Then Things Fall Apart
I don't want to say it, I truly don't, but if you've gone this far I suppose it's obvious that what was ignited when I loved you continues to burn. But that's of small importance to you now, and that's how it should be. Everything is in its place. The past rests, breathing faintly in the darkness. It no longer holds me as it used to; now I must reach back to touch it. It is night and I am alone and there is still time, a moment more. I am standing on a long black stage, with a circle of light on me, which is my love for you, enduring. I have escapedâ€”or have been expelledâ€”from eternity and am back in time. But I step out once more to sing this aria, this confession, this testament without end. My arms open wide, not to embrace you but to embrace the world, the mystery we are caught in. There is no orchestra, no audience; it is an empty theater in the middle of the night and all the clocks in the world are ticking. And now for this last time, Jade, I don't mind, or even ask if it is madness: I see your face, I see you, you; I see you in every seat. - Scott Spencer, Endless Love
For you was I born, for you do I have life, for you will I die, for you am I now dying. - Garcilaso de la Vega
Mature men look into the ladies hearts.Immature ones mention constantly their body parts.They mentioned sex like they're obsessed.Enslaved by drugs and alcohol -  helpless.
She could have rambled with all the fervor of a woman who had loved one entity for longer than most races live, and with the inviolable, unquestioned certainty found in dementia. There were references dated and sealed with meticulous care which she would have enthusiastically opened with the mirth of one proclaiming a lifetime of honors and awards. But that singular event was freshly disturbed; its pores still drifted on the faint zephyr of remembrance. - Darrell Drake, Everautumn
With the help of fanzines and close attention to the text of the game you can actually learn to speak Tsolyanu while wondering why the school still makes you learn Frenchâ€“it's not like you're going to use it. - Mark Barrowcliffe, The Elfish Gene: Dungeons, Dragons And Growing Up Strange
Two words from him, and I had seen my pouting apathy change into I'll play anything for you till you ask me to stop, till it's time for lunch, till the skin on my fingers wears off layer after layer, because I like doing things for you, will do anything for you, just say the word... - AndrÃ© Aciman

how we rolled up the carpet so we could dance, and the days were bright red, and every time we kissed there was anotherappleto slice into pieces.Look at the light through the windowpane. That means it's noon,that meanswe're inconsolable.Tell me how all this, and love too, will ruin us.These our bodies, possessed by light.Tell me we'll never get used to it. - Richard Siken
Obsession -  when thoughts are held captive and no longer your own.
Laura, this isn't love. Love lets you go on a trip without following you. Love can live without you for a week, knowing you'll come back.''No, it can't.' The afternoon shadows grew long and cold. In spite of the chill, a heat rose up inside her and flooded her face. 'That's how you know it's true love. When he can't live without you.'Karen shook her head. 'That's how you know it's obsession. Or something else. - Natalie Standiford, The Boy on the Bridge
Reality isn't the most pleasant of atmospheres, Lieutenant. But we like to think we're engineered for it. It's a pretty fine piece of engineering, the kind an engineer can respect. Drag in an obsession and reality can't tolerate it. Something has to give; if reality goes, your fine piece of engineering is left with nothing to operate on. Nothing it was designed to operate on. So it operates badly. So kick the obsession out; start functioning the way you were designed to function. - Theodore Sturgeon, More Than Human
Much better now. And Sunnyâ€”there's no such thing as 'too much' when it comes to us. Too much mutual interest, or awareness, or desire, or too much damn loveâ€”there's no such thing.""I love you beyond obsession," I murmur, terrified because it is too much."I love you to insanity," he replies, utterly solemn. "That's who I am, and that is who we are. I don't have any qualms about admitting it, and I don't have any regrets. Do you? - Olivia Lynde, Summer's Desire

He could quite quickly become detached from the nuances of common human emotion. Particularly if he was engaged in some aspect of a scientific problem or research. His work excluded any consideration for the feelings of those around him. And he rarely excused himself or justified his behavior. It was as if he was compelled to focus all his energy on one subject and was unaware that others did not follow his obsession. - Theresa Breslin, The Medici Seal
Ingo was a fever, and so far she hadn't found the antidote. - Margaret Way, Black Ingo
A colleague once described political theorists as people who were obsessed with two dozen books; after half a century of grappling with Mill's essay On Liberty, or Hobbes's Leviathan, I have sometimes thought two dozen might be a little on the high side. - Alan Ryan, On Politics: A New History of Political Philosophy
I see love, like art, as an obsession. Maybe that's an overly romantic view of human existence, but I'm an overly romantic human being. If love, like rock and roll, doesn't consume me 24-7, it's not love. It can be respect, appreciation, admiration, wonderment, it can be a world of glory and a lifetime of peace, but I can't call it love. Love burns me and confuses me. Love's a light that can't be extinguished. - Scott Weiland, Not Dead & Not for Sale
Cure for an obsession: get another one. - Mason Cooley
Ever since her obsession with Jonathan Cain, a deranged transfer student who had been at Sweet Valley for a month, Enid's life had been entirely guyless. - Francine Pascal, Model Flirt

It is also aimed at experienced human rights activists who are looking for a handy collection of facts to use in any confrontations online â€“ or in real life. - Christina Engela, The Pink Community - The Facts
To make a claim of ownership implies a claim against others. That is, others must refrain from interfering with your use of that thing. As such the very act of the body occupying its standing room is to make a claim against others because only one body can occupy the space at a time. - Daniel Alexander Brackins, Private Property, Law, and the State
Because rights are only claims against other people, and not claims on other people and their property, rights end when they infringe on the rights of others. - Daniel Alexander Brackins, Private Property, Law, and the State

Whether vampires should have been declared â€˜alive' and full citizens of the United States of America was one of the big debates ranking right up there with gun rights and abortion.

The corrupt system made the ordinary citizen absolutely powerless and without rights - Sunday Adelaja

Indeed, if the Framers intended unenumerated rights to be protected without a bill of rights, how can we imagine that those rights were meant to be any less secure with a bill of rights. - Roger Pilon
I have to have a degree of not doing a degree"! - â€• Mr. Ashfaq
The same touchy sense of personal honor that is at the root of Achilles' wrath still governs relations between man and man in modern Greece; Greek society still fosters in the individual a fierce sense of his privileges, no matter how small, of his rights, no matter how confined, of his personal worth, no matter how low. And to defend it, he will stop, like Achilles, at nothing. - Bernard Knox, The Oldest Dead White European Males & Other Reflections on the Classics
I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen's Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to "order" than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says: "I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action"; who paternalistically believes he can set the timetable for another man's freedom; who lives by a mythical concept of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait for a "more convenient season. - Martin Luther King Jr.
You told me once that freedom was my right.â€ I held his gaze. â€œMaybe you should do something with it. - Samantha Shannon, The Mime Order
The State is not God. It has not the right to take away what it cannot restore when it wants to. - Anton Chekhov
My mom said once that education was a privilege not afforded to everyone, but she was wrong--it wasn't a privilege. It was our right. We had the right to a future. - Alexandra Bracken, The Darkest Minds
Without Freedom of Thought, there can be no such Thing as Wisdom; and no such Thing as publick Liberty, without Freedom of Speech; which is the Right of every Man, as far as by it, he does not hurt or controul the Right of another: And this is the only Check it ought to suffer, and the only Bounds it ought to know. - Benjamin Franklin
That's the worst part, that so many would not value their own unique abilities, not value themselves, much less respect those who have fought and died so that they could live free to make the choice to surrender that precious right of choice â€“long with their gift and individuality.â€She gripped the blanket in a fist. â€œI often think that the y deserve everything they're going to get. I only regret that those of us who value what we have will suffer the same fate. They're the ones I fight for. The rest of them be damned.â€Alex swallowed at the pain so clearly evident in her voice. â€œWe have people like that in our world, too. People who say that freedom is no longer practical, that we must surrender it for a greater common good.â€â€œFear them,â€ she whispered. â€œThey are the heart of evil. They tolerate tyranny, excuse it, compromise with it. In doing so they always bring savagery and death upon the rest of us. - Terry Goodkind, The Law of Nines
So, take the idea of "rights" and drip some acid on it. Even the most adult of the Ancients knew: the source of a right is power, a right is a function of power. Take two trays of a weighing scale: put a gram on one, and on the other, put a ton. On one side is the "I", on the other is the "WE", the One State. Isn't it clear? Assuming that "I" has the same "rights" compared to the State is exactly the same thing as assuming that a gram can counterbalance a ton. Here is the distribution: a ton has rights, a gram has duties. And this is the natural path from insignificance to greatness: forget that you are a gram, and feel as though you are a millionth part of the ton... - Yevgeny Zamyatin, We
Without the right to defend yourself--and the right to possesss the means to do it--all other supposed rights are so much hot air. - James Carlos Blake

The freedom to share one's insights and judgments verbally or in writing is, just like the freedom to think, a holy and inalienabl e right of humanity that, as a universal human right, is above all the rights of princes. - Carl Friedrich Bahrdt, The Edict of Religion, a Comedy, and the Story and Diary of My Imprisonment
The man's rights and the woman's rights are the same size. They have the right to have their opinions and desires respected, to have a 50 percent say in decision making, to live free from verbal abuse and physical harm. Their children's rights are somewhat smaller but substantial nonetheless; children can't have an equal say in decisions because of their limited knowledge and experience, but they do have the right to live free from abuse and fear, to be treated with respect, and to have their voices heard on all issues that concern them. - Lundy Bancroft, Why Does He Do That?: Inside the Minds of Angry and Controlling Men
Get up, stand up, stand up for your rights. - Bob Marley
The notion of obligations comes before that of rights, which is subordinate and relative to the former. A right is not effectual by itself, but only in relation to the obligation to which it corresponds, the effective exercise of a right springing not from the individual who possesses it, but from other men who consider themselves as being under a certain obligation towards him. Recognition of an obligation makes it effectual. An obligation which goes unrecognized by anybody loses none of the full force of its existence. A right which goes unrecognized by anybody is not worth very much. It makes nonsense to say that men have, on the one hand, rights, and on the other hand, obligations. Such words only express differences in point of view. The actual relationship between the two is as between object and subject. A man, considered in isolation, only has duties, amongst which are certain duties towards himself. A man left alone in the universe would have no rights whatever, but he would have obligations. - Simone Weil, The Need for Roots: Prelude to a Declaration of Duties Towards Mankind
Property has its duties as well as its rights. - Thomas Drummond
What is the use of discussing a man's abstract right to food or medicine? The question is upon the method of procuring and administering them. In that deliberation I shall always advise to call in the aid of the farmer and the physician rather than the professor of metaphysics. - Edmund Burke, Reflections on the Revolution in France

Upon this dispute not alone our lands and goods are engaged, but all that we call ours. These rights, these privileges, which made our fathers freemen, are in question. - John Eliot
The condition of women in a nation is the real measure of its progress. - NgÅ©gÄ© wa Thiong'o, Wizard of the Crow

Humans have too many rights and not enough responsibilities.-Aras - Karen Traviss, City of Pearl
Who will protect your rights better? A king, president or you? Who will protect the truth? A reporter, a labor union or you? Who will protect and teach your children to seek truth? A textbook committee, an education bureaucrat, or you? Did a commission of wise men stop the Holocaust? Did a committee of Congress end Jim Crow? No. In each case, the work was done by individuals who would not abide convenient lies. They saw injustice and they called it out. They saw their nation wage war against a single group and they said â€œnot in my name.â€ They didn't wait for the conventions of society to catch up to God's laws. They pushed. They pressed. And they were victorious. - Glenn Beck
I never think of myself as an attacker, only as a defender - usually of rights - mine and others. - Jay Woodman
Rights are a protection from society. But only by fulfilling their obligations to society can the individual give meaning to that protection.(V - From Ideology Towards Equilibrium) - John Ralston Saul, The Unconscious Civilization
I think it is true to say only an inferior person has rights. When you hear a person talking about his rights, you may be sure he is trying to gain by dint of shouting something which he lacks ( or had and lost) by reason of some culpable deficiency in himself. - Flann O'Brien
This wasn't the Dark Ages, and she wasn't living in a third world nation where women didn't have any rights and were treated unequally. - Missy Lyons, Alien Promise

There is no such thing as "the right to enslave".A nation can do it , just as a man can become a criminal - but neither can do it by right. It doesn't matter in this context, whether a nation was enslaved by force (like soviet Russia), or by vote (like Nazi Germany). - Ayn Rand, The Virtue of Selfishness: A New Concept of Egoism
What rights are those that dare not resist for them? - Alfred Tennyson
There will always be wars," Maggie told him."Yes," Reeve replied. "But there will also be brothers, sisters, comrades and lovers as well, and they are who we fight for. Our comrades--our brothers--beside us on the field; our wives and families at home. Wallace wishes for freedom. It is a gife given by God and should not be taken by men; it is the right of every man to be free and it is our duty to protect that right so that our children may know what it is to be free and not live under oppression. - Hazel B. West, On a Foreign Field: A Story of Loyalty and Brotherhood
A right is not what someone gives you -  it's what no one can take from you.
Dont ever be impressed with goal setting; be impressed with goal getting. Reaching new goals and moving to a higher level of performance always requires change, and change feels awkward. But take comfort in the knowledge that if a change doesn't feel uncomfortable, then it's propably not really a change. - John C. Maxwell, Thinking for a Change: 11 Ways Highly Successful People Approach Life and Work
You've got choices, like any other creature. You can stumble down that road, pretending you can't help it. You can curl up and die of regret and sorrow for what you've done. Or you can get up and fight, even though the battle might be lost.-Finn - Kersten Hamilton, Tyger Tyger
She sits down and puts her hand to her chest and rocks. Thinks of all she has lost and will lose. All she has had and will have. It seems to her that life is like gathering berries into an apron with a hole. Why do we keep on? Because the berries are beautiful, and we must eat to survive. We catch what we can. We walk past what we lose for the promise of more, just ahead. - Elizabeth Berg, Home Safe

Hermes bowed his head in thankfulness to the Great Dragon who had taught him so much, and begged to hear more concerning the ultimate of the human soul. So Poimandres resumed: "At death the material body of man is returned to the elements from which it came, and the invisible divine man ascends to the source from whence he came, namely the Eighth Sphere..."Then, being naked of all the accumulations of the seven Rings, the soul comes to the Eighth Sphere, namely, the ring of the fixed stars. Here, freed of all illusion, it dwells in the Light and sings praises to the Father in a voice which only the pure of spirit may understand. Behold, O Hermes, there is a great mystery in the Eighth Sphere, for the Milky Way is the seed-ground of souls, and from it they drop into the Rings, and to the Milky Way they return again from the wheels of Saturn. But some cannot climb the seven-runged ladder of the Rings. So they wander in darkness below and are swept into eternity with the illusion of sense and earthiness."The path to immortality is hard, and only a few find it. The rest await the Great Day when the wheels of the universe shall be stopped and the immortal sparks shall escape from the sheaths of substance. Woe unto those who wait, for they must return again, unconscious and unknowing, to the seed-ground of stars, and await a new beginning. Those who are saved by the light of the mystery which I have revealed unto you, O Hermes, and which I now bid you to establish among men, shall return again to the Father who dwelleth in the White Light, and shall deliver themselves up to the Light and shall be absorbed into the Light, and in the Light they shall become Powers in God. This is the Way of Good and is revealed only to them that have wisdom. - Thoth Hermes Trismegistus

The first rule you need to know is FAILURE IS NOT AN OPTION!

You are all talking a bit too much, said Armando, who had cautioned them from the beginning to stay out of popular culture and in their own interior worlds.When you are caught up in the world that you did not design as support for your life and the life of earth and people, it is like being caught in someone else's dream or nightmare. Many people exist in their lives in this way. I say exist because it is not really living. It is akin to being suspended in a dream one is having at night, a dream over which one has no control. You are going here and there, seeing this and that person; you do not know or care about them usually, they are just there, on your interior screen. Humankind will not survive if we continue in this way, most of us living lives in which our own life is not the center. - Alice Walker, The Way Forward is with a Broken Heart

Freedom is that which comes from knowledge, the freedom that comes from curiosity, the freedom that comes from the times when the first man did not refuse to look into a telescope and discovered other planets, the freedom that comes from those who tried relentlessly when all others said it was impossible. It is in this freedom that deviance has its roots. - Massimo Marino, Daimones

Because that happened to me when I was little, this is how I will now treat other people"; "Because so and so beat me up and hurt me a long time ago, that gives me the right to treat people the way I treat them, today"; "Because life was hard on me, life should be hard on everyone else around me"â€” does this sound/ look familiar? It's called victim mentality. When people choose to be the direct product of everything that happened to them, the direct product of every single pair of hands that hurt them. And the world, to these people, must bend over backwards in order to accommodate their wounds. Some people don't want to be loved; they just want to make the world pay. - C. JoyBell C.
Okay, I know--my superpower--I'd be able to shoot lightening bolts out from my fingertips--great big knowledge network lightening bolts--and when a person was zapped by one of those bolts, they'd fall down on their knees and once on their knees, they'd be under water, in this place I saw once off the east coast of the Bahamas, a place where a billion electric blue fish swam up to me and made me a part of their school--and then they'd be up in the air, up in Manhattan, above the World Trade Center, with a flock of pigeons, flying amid the skyscrapers, and then--then what? And then they'd go blind, and then they'd be taken away--they'd feel homesick--more homesick than they'd felt in their entire life--so homesick they were throwing up--and they'd be abandoned, I don't know...in the middle of a harvested corn field in Missouri. And then they'd be able to see again, and from the edges of the field people would appear--everybody they'd known--and they'd be carrying Black Forest cakes and burning tiki lamps and boom boxes playing the same song, and they sky would turn into a sunset, the way it does in Walt Disney brochure, and the person I zapped would never be alone or isolated again. - Douglas Coupland, All Families are Psychotic

In many respects, the United States is a great country. Freedom of speech is protected more than in any other country. It is also a very free society. In America, the professor talks to the mechanic. They are in the same category. - Noam Chomsky
I have a map of the United States... Actual size. It says, 'Scale: 1 mile = 1 mile.' I spent last summer folding it. I hardly ever unroll it. People ask me where I live, and I say, 'E6. - Steven Wright
The American system is the most ingenious system of control in world history. With a country so rich in natural resources, talent, and labor power the system can afford to distribute just enough wealth to just enough people to limit discontent to a troublesome minority. It is a country so powerful, so big, so pleasing to so many of its citizens that it can afford to give freedom of dissent to the small number who are not pleased. There is no system of control with more openings, apertures, leeways, flexibilities, rewards for the chosen, winning tickets in lotteries. There is none that disperses its controls more complexly through the voting system, the work situation, the church, the family, the school, the mass media--none more successful in mollifying opposition with reforms, isolating people from one another, creating patriotic loyalty. - Howard Zinn, A People's History of the United States
The Constitution. . . illustrates the complexity of the American system: that it serves the interests of a wealthy elite, but also does enough for small property owners, for middle-income mechanics and farmers, to build a broad base of support. The slightly prosperous people who make up this base of support are buffers against the blacks, the Indians, the very poor whites. They enable the elite to keep control with a minimum of coercion, a maximum of law--all made palatable by the fanfare of patriotism and unity. - Howard Zinn, A People's History of the United States

Americanism in all its forms seemed to be trashy and wasteful and crude, even brutal. There was a metaphor ready to hand in my native Hampshire. Until some time after the war, the squirrels of England had been red. I can still vaguely remember these sweet Beatrix Potterâ€“type creatures, smaller and prettier and more agile and lacking the rat-like features that disclose themselves when you get close to a gray squirrel. These latter riffraff, once imported from America by some kind of regrettable accident, had escaped from captivity and gradually massacred and driven out the more demure and refined English breed. It was said that the gray squirrels didn't fight fair and would with a raking motion of their back paws castrate the luckless red ones. Whatever the truth of that, the sighting of a native English squirrel was soon to be a rarity, confined to the north of Scotland and the Isle of Wight, and this seemed to be emblematic, for the anxious lower middle class, of a more general massification and de-gentrification and, well, Americanization of everything. - Christopher Hitchens, Hitch-22: A Memoir
I thought of a remark . . . that the United States is like a 'gigantic boiler. Once the fire is lighted under it there is no limit to the power it can generate.'

What led to September 11 is that most decision makers in the White House thought like you. They supported despotic regimes in the Middle East to multiply the profits of oil and arms companies, and armed violence escalated and reached our shores. - Alaa Al Aswany, Ø´ÙŠÙƒØ§Ø¬Ùˆ
A little later, the Apollo mission was consummated and there were Americans on the moon. I remember distinctly looking up from the quad on what was quite a moon-flooded night, and thinking about it. They made it! The Stars and Stripes are finally flown on another orb! Also, English becomes the first and only language spoken on a neighboring rock! Who could forbear to cheer? Still, the experience was poisoned for me by having to watch Richard Nixon smirking as he babbled to the lunar-nauts by some closed-circuit link. Was even the silvery orb to be tainted by the base, earthbound reality of imperialism? - Christopher Hitchens, Hitch-22: A Memoir
Well, then what the federal government should have done was accept the assistance of foreign countries, of entrepreneurial Americans who have had solutions that they wanted presented. They can't even get a phone call returned, Bill. The Dutchâ€”they are known, and the Norwegiansâ€”they are known for dikes and for cleaning up water and for dealing with spills. They offered to help and yet, no, they too, with the proverbial, can't even get a phone call back. - Sarah Palin
Among the privileges of being a superpower, the right and the ability to make a local quarrel into a global one ranks very high. - Christopher Hitchens
Lefever describes his financing plan with modesty:"'Our detailed budget is realistic, but does not take into account the inflation that may occur before September 1983. The one place it could cut or reduce is item 7, the simultaneous interpreter services, if these services could be provided gratis by the U.S. government.'""In other words, the only way to make a saving on a U.S.-subsidized project is to take money out of another U.S.-subsidized column. - Christopher Hitchens
Anyone intent on moral clarity might want to find another book and, in fact, might not want to go anywhere near the enduring chasm of race in the United States. - Timothy B. Tyson, Blood Done Sign My Name: A True Story
[T]he hyphenation question is, and always has been and will be, different for English immigrants. One can be an Italian-American, a Greek-American, an Irish-American and so forth. (Jews for some reason prefer the words the other way around, as in 'American Jewish Congress' or 'American Jewish Committee.') And any of those groups can and does have a 'national day' parade on Fifth Avenue in New York. But there is no such thing as an 'English-American' let alone a 'British-American,' and one can only boggle at the idea of what, if we did exist, our national day parade on Fifth Avenue might look like. One can, though, be an Englishman in America. There is a culture, even a literature, possibly a language, and certainly a diplomatic and military relationship, that can accurately be termed 'Anglo-American.' But something in the very landscape and mapping of America, with seven eastern seaboard states named for English monarchs or aristocrats and countless hamlets and cities replicated from counties and shires across the Atlantic, that makes hyphenation redundant. Hyphenationâ€”if one may be bluntâ€”is for latecomers. - Christopher Hitchens, Hitch-22: A Memoir
I can see why people find him [Hugo ChÃ¡vez] charming. He's very ebullient, as they say. I've heard him make a speech, though, and he has a vice that's always very well worth noticing because it's always a bad sign: he doesn't know when to sit down. He's worse than Castro was. He won't shut up. Then he told me that he didn't think the United States landed on the moon and didn't believe in the existence of Osama bin Laden. He thought all of this was all a put-up job. He's a wacko. - Christopher Hitchens
There is no way that the new WikiLeaks leaks don't leave Hillary Clinton holding the smoking gun. The time for her departure may come next week or next month, but sooner or later, the weakened and humiliated secretary of state will have to pay. - Jack Shafer
Everybody is comparing the oil spill to Hurricane Katrina, but the real parallel could be the Iranian hostage crisis. In the late 1970s, the hostage crisis became a symbol of America's inability to take decisive action in the face of pervasive problems. In the same way, the uncontrolled oil plume could become the objective correlative of the country's inability to govern itself. - David Brooks
Not to dampen any parade, but if one asks if there is a single thing about Mr. Obama's Senate record, or state legislature record, or current program, that could possibly justify his claim to the presidency one gets ... what? Not much. Similarly lightweight unqualified 'white' candidates have overcome this objection, to be sure, but what kind of standard is that? - Christopher Hitchens
Life in Britain had seemed like one long antechamber to a room that had too many barriers to entry -  here in the USA it seemed to be true that if you dared to give things 'your best shot' then the other much-used phrases like 'land of opportunity' would kick in as well.

One of the real reasons that Russia's President Vladimir Putin is so intent on remaining loyal to Syria's Dictator Bashar Al-Assad, is that in January 2017, Russia and Syria signed a lease to extend Russia's control of its naval facility in the port of Tartus, Syria for 49 years. As with the United States Naval Base in Guantanamo, Cuba, the Russians have sovereign rights over the territory, considered a Material-Technical Support Point and not technically a naval base. The piers are large enough to accommodate four medium-sized vessels but not any of their larger ships of the line, including cruisers or their aircraft carrier. The facility which gives Russia a warm water port, consists of office space, two storage buildings, barracks and a parking garage for about six vehicles. Under the terms of this lease agreement, the Russians also operate Khmeimim Air Base located south-east of the city of Latakia, Syria. The present lease for these military facilities has an extension clause for an additional 25 years. - Captain Hank Bracker, The Exciting Story of Cuba

Is it that bad, Mrs. Bowen?" Clement asked.Emily shook her head. "Gertrude's been hurt and so she's generalizing. It's a pretty good country on the whole, and the people in it, too. We have our faults and they may be glaring, and we have individuals we may not be proud of, but take us by and large we'll stick our necks our for something we believe in, and that in itself may be a fault, but it's one I like.""Bravo," Abe said. - Madeleine L'Engle
The nation had had two symbols of solitude, the forest and the prairies; now it had a third, the mountains. - Bernard DeVoto, The Year of Decision 1846
What does â€˜United States of America' mean? That we're some states, we're united somehow, and that we're in America. America could be anywhere on the continents of North or South America, so that's not specific enough, and the part about the states doesn't narrow it down, either. Mexico has united states, too. So does Canada, except they call them provinces. It's not even a name. It's just a vague description. It's so generic, like naming a country â€˜Country. - Erin O'Riordan, Cut

Detroit is just like everywhere else, only more so--a lot more so. - Jerry Herron
In the spring of 1990 I flew to Aspen, Colorado, to cover a summit meeting between Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and President George Herbert Walker Bush. This fairly routine political event took on sudden significance when, on the evening before the talks were scheduled to begin, Saddam Hussein announced that the independent state of Kuwait had, by virtue of a massive deployment of military force, become a part of Iraq. We were not to know that this actâ€”and the name Saddam Husseinâ€”would dominate international politics for the next decade and more, but it was still possible to witness something extraordinary: the sight of Mrs. Thatcher publicly inserting quantities of lead into George Bush's pencil. The spattering quill of a Ralph Steadman would be necessary to do justice to such a macabre yet impressive scene. - Christopher Hitchens, Ancient Gonzo Wisdom: Interviews with Hunter S. Thompson
He pondered that a little while and then he asked, do Black people have to pay for their doctors, too? Because that's what TV programs had said. I smiled a little at this and told him it's not only Black people who have to pay for doctors and medical care; all people in America have to. Ah, he said. And suppose you don't have the money to pay? Well, I said, if you don't have the money to pay, sometimes you died. And there was no mistaking my gesture, even though he had to wait for the translator to translate it. We left him looking absolutely nonplussed, standing in the middle of the square with his mouth open and his hand under his chin staring after me, as in utter amazement that human beings could die from lack of medical care. It's things like that that keep me dreaming about Russia long after I've returned. - Audre Lorde, Sister Outsider: Essays and Speeches
Eight years in the Wolston academy and I knew it all came down to the next 90 minutes. - P.J. Davitt, One Shot at Glory
...Americans didn't stick to cities, which makes us different from the people in other industrialized countries. We no sooner arrived in town, turning those towns into great mid-century metropolises, than we decided to take off for the green world beyond, so that by the 1970 Census, we had become the first suburban nation in the history of the world. And Detroit led the way, with a population curve up and down just like everywhere else, but with its urban decline a lot steeper over the past sixty yearsâ€”so typical a place that it only looks like an exception. - Jerry Herron
It is hard to imagine having a government more secretive than the United States. Virtually everything that government does, of any significance, is conducted behind an extreme wall of secrecy. The very few leaks that we've had over the last decade are basically the only ways that we've had to learn what our government is doing. - Glenn Greenwald

Somehow, all the talk about tenure and anthropology had given her visions of a thick-walled, libraried adobe, the kind of place that was covered with kilim rugs and fertility sculptures.

Those were comfortable, carefree years. The word I'd use now is idyllic. On Friday nights, we cheered on the Bulldogs of Midland High. On Sunday mornings, we went to church. Nobody locked their doors. Years later, when I would speak about the American Dream, it was Midland I had in mind. - George W. Bush, Decision Points
While working in California, I met William Valentiner and Edgar Richardson of the Detroit Institute of Arts. I mentioned a desire which I had to paint a series of murals about the industries of the United States, a series that would constitute a new kind of plastic poem, depicting in color and form the story of each industry and its division of labor. Dr. Valentiner was keenly interested, considering my idea a potential base for a new school of modern art in America, as related to the social structure of American life as the art of the Middle Ages had been related to medieval society. - Diego Rivera, My Art, My Life

The world became more aware that America-despite being the hope of many who have the personal drive and ambition to become part of the "American dream"-is beset by serious operational challenges: a massive and growing national debt, widening social inequality, a cornucopian culture that worships materialism, a financial system given to greedy speculation, and a polarized political system - Zbigniew BrzeziÅ„ski, Strategic Vision: America and the Crisis of Global Power

The New START accord cuts the strategic nuclear arsenals on each side to 1,550 warheads. Can any of its critics make a case that our security would be imperiled if, the very next day, Obama and Medvedev made moves to take the levels down to 1,000â€”then to 500?If so, come show us the math. If not, it may be time to stop making arms control so politically complicatedâ€”time to stop letting arms control get in the way of disarmament. - Fred Kaplan
A number I'd love to know: the % of those now saying 'we have to vote Obama to stop an attack on Iran' who will support one if Obama does it. - Glenn Greenwald

Sneaky and underhanded, the Federal Reserve has been sucking the life blood out of the United States since 1913. Like a black widow spider, it weaves a web of corruption and deceit. Unknown to its prey, the FED's bite is poisonous, deep, long-lasting and brings financial upheaval and misery to Americans. - Jim  McCarthy, The Money Spiders, the Ruin-NATION of the United States by the Federal Reserve

One thing I learned going through a storm and that is, you can Praise God in the dark! If God makes light to shine out of darkness, well bless God, I can call forth light into my situation. I am the light of God. Praising Him is not determined by day or night. In whatever state I find myself in, I will continue to acknowledge Him. Then and only then, He will direct my path. - Shelena Griffiths

When satan sees a baby, however, he doesn't see a fragile, sweet, gurgling child; he sees a potential grown-up who is bought by the blood of the lamb and filled with the power of the Holy Ghost, a servant of God and a soldier of the cross, a great threat to his kingdom. - Theresa Pecku-Laryea, Hannah's Song

NEVER SACRIFICE YOUR VALUES & MORALS FOR RICHES OR FAME. IT'S A PAYMENT THAT'S NON-REFUNDABLE - Sotero M Lopez II
There is a wide difference between having poison and being poisoned. All apothecaries have poisons ready for special uses, but they are not consequently poisoned, because the poison is only in their shop, not in themselves; and so you many possess riches without being poisoned by them, so long as they are in your house or purse only, and not in your heart. It is the Christian's privilege to be rich in material things , and poor in attachment to them. - St. Francis de Sales

If you are lucky enough to have lived in Paris as a young man, then wherever you go for the rest of your life, it stays with you, for Paris is a moveable feast. - Ernest Hemingway, A Moveable Feast
But Paris was a very old city and we were young and nothing was simple there, not even poverty, nor sudden money, nor the moonlight, nor right and wrong nor the breathing of someone who lay beside you in the moonlight. - Ernest Hemingway, A Moveable Feast: The Restored Edition

I love the night passionately. I love it as I love my country, or my mistress, with an instinctive, deep, and unshakeable love. I love it with all my senses: I love to see it, I love to breathe it in, I love to open my ears to its silence, I love my whole body to be caressed by its blackness. Skylarks sing in the sunshine, the blue sky, the warm air, in the fresh morning light. The owl flies by night, a dark shadow passing through the darkness; he hoots his sinister, quivering hoot, as though he delights in the intoxicating black immensity of space.  - Guy de Maupassant
Dangerous as a lightning strike, as lethal as a pair of crisscrossing short swords, William whispered, â€œYou're about to find out how your liver tastes, my friend.â€â€œI have tasted it already,â€ Zacharel said, his voice its usual monotone. The snowflakes began to fall in earnest, tiny at first, but growing in diameter. An arctic wind blustered around him. â€œIt was a bit salty.â€How the hell was a guy supposed to respond to that?Apparently William didn't know, either, because he gaped at the angel. Then, â€œMaybe if you added a little pepper?â€O-kay. It was official. William had an answer for everything. - Gena Showalter, The Darkest Seduction

Oh, London is a man's town, there's power in the air;And Paris is a woman's town, with flowers in her hair;And it's sweet to dream in Venice, and it's great to study Rome;But when it comes to living, there is no place like home. - Henry Van Dyke
We'll always have Paris. - Howard Koch
Paris was a universe whole and entire unto herself, hollowed and fashioned by history; so she seemed in this age of Napoleon III with her towering buildings, her massive cathedrals, her grand boulevards and ancient winding medieval streets--as vast and indestructible as nature itself. All was embraced by her, by her volatile and enchanted populace thronging the galleries, the theaters, the cafes, giving birth over and over to genius and sanctity, philosophy and war, frivolity and the finest art; so it seemed that if all the world outside her were to sink into darkness, what was fine, what was beautiful, what was essential might there still come to its finest flower. Even the majestic trees that graced and sheltered her streets were attuned to her--and the waters of the Seine, contained and beautiful as they wound through her heart; so that the earth on that spot, so shaped by blood and consciousness, had ceased to be the earth and had become Paris. - Anne Rice, Interview with the Vampire
He who contemplates the depths of Paris is seized with vertigo.Nothing is more fantastic. Nothing is more tragic.Nothing is more sublime. - Victor Hugo
There is but one Paris and however hard living may be here, and if it became worse and harder evenâ€”the French air clears up the brain and does goodâ€”a world of good. - Vincent van Gogh
I guess it goes to show that you just never know where life will take you. You search for answers. You wonder what it all means. You stumble, and you soar. And, if you're lucky, you make it to Paris for a while. - Amy Thomas, Paris, My Sweet: A Year in the City of Light
To study in Paris is to be born in Paris! - Victor Hugo, Les MisÃ©rables
In Paris the cashiers sit rather than stand. They run your goods over a scanner, tally up the price, and then ask you for exact change. The story they give is that there aren't enough euros to go around. "The entire EU is short on coins."And I say, "Really?" because there are plenty of them in Germany. I'm never asked for exact change in Spain or Holland or Italy, so I think the real problem lies with the Parisian cashiers, who are, in a word, lazy. Here in Tokyo they're not just hard working but almost violently cheerful. Down at the Peacock, the change flows like tap water. The women behind the registers bow to you, and I don't mean that they lower their heads a little, the way you might if passing someone on the street. These cashiers press their hands together and bend from the waist. Then they say what sounds to me like "We, the people of this store, worship you as we might a god. - David Sedaris, When You Are Engulfed in Flames
Paris is a place in which we can forget ourselves, reinvent, expunge the dead weight of our past. - Michael Simkins, Detour de France: An Englishman in Search of a Continental Education

Study is the child of silence and mystery. - Henri Murger, The Bohemians of the Latin Quarter: Scenes de la Vie de Boheme
Paris is the city in which one loves to live. Sometimes I think this is because it is the only city in the world where you can step out of a railway stationâ€”the Gare D'Orsayâ€”and see, simultaneously, the chief enchantments: the Seine with its bridges and bookstalls, the Louvre, Notre Dame, the Tuileries Gardens, the Place de la Concorde, the beginning of the Champs Elyseesâ€”nearly everything except the Luxembourg Gardens and the Palais Royal. But what other city offers as much as you leave a train? - Margaret Anderson
If you ask the great city, â€˜Who is this person?,' she will answer, â€˜He is my child. - Victor Hugo, Les MisÃ©rables
Paris is a woman but London is an independent man puffing his pipe in a pub. - Jack Kerouac, Lonesome Traveler

Her little fists pummeled at him, and he accepted the abuse. Until he realized she'd made an improper fist and was actually hurting herself. He wound an arm around her waist, spun her and slammed her into the hard line of his body to still her.â€œLet me go!â€â€œIn a minute.â€ As she struggled, he pulled her thumb out from beneath her fingers and rearranged her fist. â€œHit like this.â€ Done, he released her. - Gena Showalter, The Darkest Seduction
Paris is a hard place to leave, even when it rains incessantly and one coughs continually from the dampness. - Willa Cather
Paris is a heaven for all woman's obssesions: hot men, great chocolates, scrumptuous pastries, sexy lingerie, cool clothes but, as any shoe-o-phile knows, this city is a hotbed of fabulous shoes. - Kirsten Lobe, Paris Hangover
You're going to have to settle on one eventually. Why not save us both the hassle, close your eyes and point. Whoever you're pointing at will be our winner." "I've played that game once before. Ended up--" Paris shuddered. "Never mind. It's not good to wander down that particular memory trail. So no. Just no. - Gena Showalter, The Darkest Passion
The wrought-iron gate squeaked as Lucas opened it. He lowered the rented bike down the stone steps and onto the sidewalk. To his right was the most famous Globe Hotel in Paris, disguised under another name. In front of the entrance five Curukians sat on mopeds. Lu-cas and his eighteen-month-old friend then shot out across the street and through the invisible beam of an-other security camera.He rode diagonally across the place de la Concorde and headed toward the river. It seemed only natural. The motorcycles trailed him. He pedaled fast across the Alex-andre III bridge and zipped past Les Invalides hospital. He tried to turn left at the Rodin Museum, but Goper rode next to him, blocking his escape. - Paul Aertker, Brainwashed
The sign above the door was written in French. It read: ARRÃŠTE ! C'EST ICI L'EMPIRE DE LA MORT.â€œThat means,â€ he explained to Gini, â€œâ€˜Stop! It is here the Empire of Death. - Paul Aertker, Brainwashed

Well,' I said, â€˜Paris is old, is many centuries. You feel, in Paris, all the time gone by. That isn't what you feel in New York â€” 'He was smiling. I stopped.â€˜What do you feel in New York?' he asked.â€˜Perhaps you feel,' I told him, â€˜all the time to come. There's such power there, everything is in such movement. You can't help wonderingâ€”I can't help wonderingâ€”what it will all be likeâ€”many years from now. - James     Baldwin, Giovanni's Room
Admirable, however, as the Paris of the present day appears to you, build up and put together again in imagination the Paris of the fifteenth century; look at the light through that surprising host of steeples, towers, and belfries; pour forth amid the immense city, break against the points of its islands, compress within the arches of the bridges, the current of the Seine, with its large patches of green and yellow, more changeable than a serpent's skin; define clearly the Gothic profile of this old Paris upon an horizon of azure, make its contour float in a wintry fog which clings to its innumerable chimneys; drown it in deep night, and observe the extraordinary play of darkness and light in this sombre labyrinth of buildings; throw into it a ray of moonlight, which shall show its faint outline and cause the huge heads of the towers to stand forth from amid the mist; or revert to that dark picture, touch up with shade the thousand acute angles of the spires and gables, and make them stand out, more jagged than a shark's jaw, upon the copper-coloured sky of evening. Now compare the two. - Victor Hugo, The Hunchback of Notre-Dame
As an artist, a man has no home in Europe save in Paris. - Friedrich Nietzsche
I love Paris in the summer, when it sizzles. - Cole Porter
For a painter, the Mecca of the world, for study, for inspiration and for living is here on this star called Paris. Just look at it, no wonder so many artists have come here and called it home.

I never rebel so much against France as not to regard Paris with a friendly eye; she has had my heart since my childhood.... I love her tenderly, even to her warts and her spots. I am French only by this great city: the glory of France, and one of the noblest ornaments of the world. - Michel de Montaigne
The Empire was on the point of turning Paris into the bawdy house of Europe. The gang of fortune-seekers who had succeeded in stealing a throne required a reign of adventures, shady transactions, sold consciences, bought women, and rampant drunkenness. - Ã‰mile Zola, La CurÃ©e
I used to ask myself, â€˜Sergei, would you rather spend your money on drink or women?' and thanks to the club, I spend it on both and am called a patron of the arts. - Melika Dannese Lux, City of Lights: The Trials and Triumphs of Ilyse Charpentier

I did exhibitions with the Surrealists (in Paris, in 1929) because their attitude revolted against 'art' and their attitude toward life itself was wise, as was Dada's.' Hans Arp - Lepota L. Cosmo, Love in Paris - Poetic Guide to the Romance of the City
I was thrown together with Florence, or 'Florawns' as she was called, a pert girl of nineteen who worked in our kitchen and was sent out to help me. First, I followed her to a butcher where fat sausages hung from the ceiling like aldermen's chains, and I could choose the best of plump ducks, sides of beef, and chops standing guard like sentries on parade. Once the deal was done Florence paid him, gave me a wink and cast a trickle of coins into her apron pocket. So it seemed that serving girls will pay themselves the whole world over.The size of the Paris market made Covent Garden look like a tinker's tray. And I never before saw such neatness; the cakes arranged in pinks and yellows and greens like an embroidery, and the cheeses even prettier, some as tiny as thimbles and others great solid cartwheels. As for the King Cakes the French made for Twelfth Night, the scents of almond and caramelled sugar were to me far sweeter than any perfumed waters. - Martine Bailey, An Appetite for Violets
Adele and Vladimir danced along the banks of the River Seine, the loveliness of spring a backdrop all around them. - Kristy Cambron, The Butterfly and the Violin
Nell walks what feels like the length of Paris. She walks through the numbered arrondissements, meandering through a food market, gazing at the glossy produce, both familiar and not at the same time, accepting a plum at a stallholder's urging and then buying a small bag in lieu of breakfast and lunch. She sits on a bench by the Seine, watching the tourist boats go by, and eats three of the plums, thinking of how it felt to hold the tiller, to gaze onto the moonlit waters. She tucks the bag under her arm as if she does this all the time and takes the Metro to a brocante recommended in one of her guidebooks, allowing herself an hour to float among the stalls, picking up little objects that someone once loved, mentally calculating the English prices, and putting them down again. And as she walks, in a city of strangers, her nostrils filled with the scent of street food, her ears filled with an unfamiliar language, she feels something unexpected wash through her. She feels connected, alive. - Jojo Moyes, Paris for One
Paris, viewed from the towers of Notre Dame in the cool dawn of a summer morning, is a delectable and a magnificent sight; and the Paris of that period must have been eminently so. - Victor Hugo, The Hunchback of Notre-Dame

Do all in Troy despise me?''That is a strong word, my sweet.'The young Queen of Sparta pulled away from her lover's arms. 'It is true then. I have exchanged one prison for another.'Paris gently brushed her cheek with his hand. 'If that is true, we are the most fortunate of prisoners. For we have each other and our love. - Janell Rhiannon, Rise of Princes
Helen looked up at Paris, her face wet with tears and blotchy with grief, and nodded her consent. 'Together we are chained on rocks before the beast of Poseidon. Naked and bare and helpless.''But we are more fortunate.''How so?' Helen asked.'We have each other as comfort in our misery. - Janell Rhiannon, Rise of Princes
I have always had a weakness for footnotes. For me a clever or a wicked footnote has redeemed many a text. And I see that I am now using a long footnote to open a serious subject - shifting in a quick move to Paris, to a penthouse in the Hotel Crillon. Early June. Breakfast time. The host is my good friend Professor Ravelstein, Abe Ravelstein. My wife and I, also staying at the Crillon, have a room below, on the sixth floor. She is still asleep. The entire floor below ours (this is not absolutely relevant but somehow I can't avoid mentioning it) is occupied just now by Michael Jackson and his entourage. He performs nightly in some vast Parisian auditorium. Very soon his French fans will arrive and a crowd of faces will be turned upward, shouting in unison, 'Miekell Jack-sown'. A police barrier holds the fans back. Inside, from the sixth floor, when you look down the marble stairwell you see Michael's bodyguards. One of them is doing the crossword puzzle in the 'Paris Herald'. - Saul Bellow, Ravelstein
Nell looks at the label and comes to."Oh, I'd never wear it. I like to buy things on a cost-per-wear basis. This dress would probably work out at like...thirty pounds a wear. No. I couldn't.""You don't ever do something just because it makes you feel good?" The assistant shrugs. "Mademoiselle, you need to spend more time in Paris. - Jojo Moyes, Paris for One
Quinn had never stayed at a hotel that used real keys. Most had plastic keycards--like credit cards that you slide through a sensor--though her aunt Deirdre had told her about a tiny hotel in Paris she'd once stayed at that still had brass keys attached to enormous key chains shaped like the Eiffel Tower. - Marina Cohen, The Inn Between
At night I would climb the steps to the Sacre-Coeur, and I would watch Paris, that futile oasis, scintillating in the wilderness of space. I would weep, because it was so beautiful, and because it was so useless. - Simone de Beauvoir, Memoirs of a Dutiful Daughter
I love to watch cities wake up, and Paris wakes up more abruptly, more startlingly, than any place I know. - Bill Bryson
Paris has always seemed ... the only city where you can live and express yourself as you please. - Natalie Clifford Barney
To breath the air of Paris preserves the soul. - Victor Hugo, Les MisÃ©rables
Wie Gott in Frankreich'' was the expression used by the Jews of Eastern Europe to describe perfect happiness. I puzzled over this simile for many years, and I think I can interpret it now. God would be perfectly happy in France because he would not be troubled by prayers, observances, blessings and demands for the interpretation of difficult dietary questions. Surrounded by unbelievers He too could relax toward evening, just as thousands of Parisians do at their favorite cafes. There are few things more pleasant, more civilized than a tranquil terrasse at dusk. - Saul Bellow
I have heard queens' swans, moved a man to cry,heard Bach played in the Metro on guitars.I have made love in Paris. Let me die. - Jennifer Reeser, Fleur de Lis

Paris at night is a street show of a hundred moments you might have lived. - Courtney Maum, I Am Having So Much Fun Here Without You
Paris that eternal monstrous marvel â€¦ the city of a hundred-thousand novels â€¦ a living creature, the great courtesan whose face and heart and mind-boggling morals they know: â€œTheyâ€ are the lovers of Paris. - HonorÃ© de Balzac
I had forgotten how gently time passes in Paris. As lively as the city is, there's a stillness to it, a peace that lures you in. In Paris, with a glass of wine in your hand, you can just be.All along the Seine, street lamps come on, apartment windows turn golden."It's seven," Julien says, and I realize that he has been keeping time all along, waiting. He is so American. No sitting idle, forgetting oneself, not for this young man of mine. - Kristin Hannah, The Nightingale
Many people in Paris are quite content to look on at others, and there are plenty who regard a wall behind which something is happening as a very curious thing. - Victor Hugo, The Hunchback of Notre-Dame
We are outside again, walking, when he takes a bite and stops dead. "Wow," he says after a minute. Then, "Wow," again.I smile. Everyone remembers their first taste of Paris. This will be his. - Kristin Hannah, The Nightingale
Depending on which flavor of academic scholarship you prefer, that age had its roots in the Renaissance or Mannerist periods in Germany, England, and Italy. It first bloomed in France in the garden of Jean-Jacques Rousseau in the 1780s. Others point to FranÃ§ois-RenÃ© de Chateaubriand's chÃ¢teau circa 1800 or Victor Hugo's Paris apartments in the 1820s and '30s. The time frame depends on who you ask. All agree Romanticism reached its apogee in Paris in the 1820s to 1840s before fading, according to some circa 1850 to make way for the anti-Romantic NapolÃ©on III and the Second Empire, according to others in the 1880s when the late Romantic Decadents took over. Yet others say the period stretched until 1914â€”conveniently enduring through the debauched Belle Ã‰poque before expiring in time for World War I and the arrival of that other perennial of the pigeonhole specialists, modernism. There are those, however, who look beyond dates and tags and believe the Romantic spirit never died, that it overflowed, spread, fractured, came back together again like the Seine around its islands, morphed into other isms, changed its name and address dozens of times as Nadar and Balzac did and, like a phantom or vampire or other supernatural invention of the Romantic Age, it thrives today in billions of brains and hearts. The mother ship, the source, the living shrine of Romanticism remains the city of Paris. - David Downie, A Passion for Paris: Romanticism and Romance in the City of Light
A trip to Paris had sounded so adventurous when I was first talking about it a year earlier. People spoke about the city with dreamy longing, as though Paris possessed a magic that could not be found elsewhere. I'd never heard anyone talk about Paris without sighing. The city was a Promised Land that held appeal for most everyone: artists, lovers, even people who just liked cheese. - Jennifer Coburn, We'll Always Have Paris: A Mother/Daughter Memoir
But one gets tired of everything, even of abusing a person. Paris abandons its puppets which it raises to the throne as quickly as it does its martyrs whom it hoists on the gibbet; in its perpetual hunger for new playthings, it never gets itself excited overly much before the statues of its heroes or at the sight of the blood of its victims. - Octave Mirbeau, Le Calvaire

All the buildings lining rue de Conservatoire are constructed of cream marble or limestone. When I went outside today, the sky was pale and fierce, on the very cusp of rain. From the top of the church and the conservatory, the contrast was almost imperceptible, as if marble and air danced cheek to cheek. - Eloisa James, Paris in Love

Snapped abruptly to a realization of how rudely I had been staring, I blushed and said without thinking, "I was just wondering if you've ever been kissed by a beautiful young girl?" I went still redder as he shouted with laughter. With a broad grin, he said "Many times, madonna. But alas, it does not help. As you see. Ribbit. - Diana Gabaldon, Dragonfly in Amber
Below Les Avants there was a chalet where the pension was wonderful and where we would be together and have our books and at night be warm in bed together with the windows open and the stars bright. That was where we could go. Traveling third class on the train was not expensive. The pension cost very little more than we spent in Paris. - Ernest Hemingway
And there, until 1884, it was possible to gaze on the remains of a generally neglected monument, so-called Dagobert's Tower, which included a ninth-century staircase set into the masonry, of which the thirty-foot handrail was fashioned out of the trunk of a gigantic oak tree. Here, according to tradition, lived a barber and a pastry-cook, who in the year 1335 plied their trade next door to each other. The reputation of the pastry-cook, whose products were among the most delicious that could be found, grew day by day. Members of the high-ranking clergy in particular were very fond of the extraordinary meat pies that, on the grounds of keeping to himself the secret of how the meats were seasoned, our man made all on his own, with the sole assistance of an apprentice who was responsible for the pastry.His neighbor the barber had won favor with the public through his honesty, his skilled hairdressing and shaving, and the steam baths he offered. Now, thanks to a dog that insistently scratched at the ground in a certain place, the ghastly origins of the meat used by the pastry-cook became known, for the animal unearthed some human bones! It was established that every Saturday before shutting up shop the barber would offer to shave a foreign student for free. He would put the unsuspecting young man in a tip-back seat and then cut his throat. The victim was immediately rushed down to the cellar, where the pastry-cook took delivery of him, cut him up, and added the requisite seasoning. For which the pies were famed, â€˜especially as human flesh is more delicate because of the diet,' old Dubreuil comments facetiously.The two wretched fellows were burned with their pies, the house was ordered to be demolished, and in its place was built a kind of expiatory pyramid, with the figure of the dog on one of its faces. The pyramid was there until 1861.But this is where the story takes another turn and joins the very best of black comedy. For the considerable number of ecclesiastics who had unwittingly consumed human flesh were not only guilty before God of the very venial sin of greed; they were automatically excommunicated! A grand council was held under the aegis of several bishops and it was decided to send to Avignon, where Pope Clement VI resided, a delegation of prelates with a view to securing the rescindment if not of the Christian interdiction against cannibalism then at least of the torments of hell that faced the inadvertent cannibals. The delegation set off, with a tidy sum of money, bare-footed, bearing candles and singing psalms. But the roads of that time were not very safe and doubtless strewn with temptation. Anyway, the fact is that Clement VI never saw any sign of the penitents, and with good reason. - Jacques Yonnet, Paris Noir: The Secret History of a City

Paris rubbed his forehead against his, running his hands through Roanâ€˜s hair, and said, 'How about we come back here and exchange notes once weâ€˜re done with the interviews?

Fortunately the City is vigilant. It too has its secret weapons. Since the summer it has released safety valves that form part of a wonderful mechanism, known only to itself. For the past three months we've noticed the most heartening appearance all over the place of eccentrics, more or less raving lunatics, cranks, and reinvigorating crackpots. - Jacques Yonnet, Paris Noir: The Secret History of a City
Paris came down the stairs looking incredible. Heâ€˜d gone with the simple classic look of the tight white T-shirt, the low-slung jeans that showed off a glimpse of his flat belly, and a black leather jacket. His hair was perfectly mussed, a calculated look that seemed natural and sexy. At the bottom of the staircase, he turned around slowly, holding his arms out to his sides. "Well, how do I look?"Damn. "Like I want to rip your clothes off right this second. Youâ€˜re gonna kill that kid. Heâ€˜s going to explode, and theyâ€˜re going to have to scrape his remains off the wall.""Yeesh, I was with you until you got descriptive.""Canâ€˜t help it.

Old Hubert must have had a premonition of his squalid demise. In October he said to me, â€˜Forty-two years I've had this place. I'd really like to go back home, but I ain't got the energy since my old girl died. And I can't sell it the way it is now. But anyway before I hang my hat up I'd be curious to know what's in that third cellar of mine.'The third cellar has been walled up by order of the civil defence authorities after the floods of 1910. A double barrier of cemented bricks prevents the rising waters from invading the upper floors when flooding occurs. In the event of storms or blocked drains, the cellar acts as a regulatory overflow.The weather was fine: no risk of drowning or any sudden emergency. There were five of us: Hubert, Gerard the painter, two regulars and myself. Old Marteau, the local builder, was upstairs with his gear, ready to repair the damage. We made a hole.Our exploration took us sixty metres down a laboriously-faced vaulted corridor (it must have been an old thoroughfare). We were wading through a disgusting sludge. At the farend, an impassable barrier of iron bars. The corridor continued beyond it, plunging downwards. In short, it was a kind of drain-trap.That's all. Nothing else. Disappointed, we retraced our steps. Old Hubert scanned the walls with his electric torch. Look! An opening. No, an alcove, with some wooden object that looks like a black statuette. I pick the thing up: it's easily removable. I stick it under my arm. I told Hubert, â€˜It's of no interest. . .' and kept this treasure for myself.I gazed at it for hours on end, in private. So my deductions, my hunches were not mistaken: the BiÃ¨vre-Seine confluence was once the site where sorcerers and satanists must surely have gathered. And this kind of primitive magic, which the blacks of Central Africa practise today, was known here several centuries ago. The statuette had miraculously survived the onslaught of time: the well-known virtues of the waters of the BiÃ¨vre, so rich in tannin, had protected the wood from rotting, actually hardened, almost fossilized it. The object answered a purpose that was anything but aesthetic. Crudely carved, probably from heart of oak. The legs were slightly set apart, the arms detached from the body. No indication of gender. Four nails set in a triangle were planted in its chest. Two of them, corroded with rust, broke off at the wood's surface all on their own. There was a spike sunk in each eye. The skull, like a salt cellar, had twenty-four holes in which little tufts of brown hair had been planted, fixed in place with wax, of which there were still some vestiges. I've kept quiet about my find. I'm biding my time. - Jacques Yonnet, Paris Noir: The Secret History of a City
She thought constantly about Paris and avidly read all the society pages in the papers. Their accounts of receptions, celebrations, the clothes worn, and all the accompanying delights enjoyed, whetted her appetite still further. Above all, however, she was fascinated by what these reports merely hinted at. The cleverly phrased allusions half-lifted a veil beyond which could be glimpsed devastatingly attractive horizons promising a whole new world of wicked pleasure. From where she lived, she looked on Paris as representing the height of all magnificent luxury as well as licentiousness...she conjured up the images of all the famous men who made the headlines and shone like brilliant comets in the darkness of her sombre sky. She pictured the madly exciting lives they must lead, moving from one den of vice to the next, indulging in never-ending and extraordinarily voluptuous orgies, and practising such complex and sophisticated sex as to defy the imagination. It seemed to her that hidden behind the faÃ§ades of the houses lining the canyon-like boulevards of the city, some amazing erotic secret must lie."The uneventful life she lived had preserved her like a winter apple in an attic. Yet she was consumed from within by unspoken and obsessive desires. She wondered if she would die without ever having tasted the wicked delights which life had to offer, without ever, not even once, having plunged into the ocean of voluptuous pleasure which, to her, was Paris. - Guy de Maupassant, A Parisian Affair and Other Stories
Here, in a few words, you've said all you need to say. People stand by each other, but they don't talk. It's remarkable. I've investigated the extraordinary history of these walls.

Sunset's the best time to take a stroll down Mouffetard, the ancient Via Mons Cetardus. The buildings along it are only two or three stories high. Many are crowned with conical dovecotes. Nowhere in Paris is the connection, the obscure kinship, between houses very close to each other more perceptible to the pedestrian than in this street.Close in age, not location. If one of them should show signs of decrepitude, if its face should sag, or it should lose a tooth, as it were, a bit of cornicing, within hours its sibling a hundred metres away, but designed according to the same plans and built by the same men, will also feel it's on its last legs.The houses vibrate in sympathy like the chords of a viola d'amore. Like cheddite charges giving each other the signal to explode simultaneously. - Jacques Yonnet, Paris Noir: The Secret History of a City
To accuse the American male of not bathing in Paris is merely to flatter him. - Elaine Dundy, The Dud Avocado
It's splendid how much at home we feel at Pignol's. A tacit complicity at every moment prevails among the regulars here. A process of self-selection operates: starving crooks, thirsty whores, witless grasses working for low-grade cops, middle- class types a bit too willing to conform (leaving aside the pound of black-market meat and the camembert without ration tickets) - all feel too ill at ease here. They've only got to stay away. Along with anyone else who doesn't meet the requirements of this establishment: first and foremost, to keep your trap shut. The war? Past history. The Krauts? Don't know any. Russia? Change at Reaumur. The police? There was a time when they were needed for directing the traffic. At Pignol's, silence constitutes the most important, most difficult and lengthiest induction ordeal.After that, it's a matter of imponderables. It works according to the rule of three: the people who don't get along with the people that I get along with are people I can't get along with. Syllogisms, of course. Now clear out! - Jacques Yonnet, Paris Noir: The Secret History of a City

Parisians take their work quite seriously, but they take their enjoyment of the little moments just as seriously. Sometimes sitting in a cafÃ© with close friends or family and enjoying a shared plate of macarons is just as important as sitting in an office working.

The Frenchman showed her a great deal of Paris that day, saying over lunch at a cafÃ© that it was impossible to see everything of interest in so short a time. "And of course the sights are only one aspect; there's also the theatre, the markets, clubs, festivals, gardens and much more."Delta smiled dreamily; it sounded wonderful.Enjoying her smile, Valois gave her cheek a playful caress.

I had walked over to the window and was looking down at the rails of the Montmartre funicular, the gardens of the SacrÃ© CÅ“ur and, further off, the whole of Paris, with its lights, its roofs, its shadows. Denise Coudreuse and I had met one day in this maze of roads and boulevards. Paths that cross, among those of thousands and thousands of people all over Paris, like countless little balls on a gigantic, electric billiard table, which occasionally bump into each other. And nothing remained of this, not even the luminous trail a firefly leaves behind it. - Patrick Modiano
It's pronounced wee but spelled O-U-I. It's all you'll want to say when you're sitting at one of the thousands of little cafes that line the streets and you're looking at a menu full of foods you just want to eat for days.

To sit indoors was silly. I postponed the search for Savchenko and Ludmila till the next day and went wandering about Paris. The men wore bowlers, the women huge hats with feathers. On the cafÃ© terraces lovers kissed unconcernedly - I stopped looking away. Students walked along the boulevard St. Michel. They walked in the middle of the street, holding up traffic, but no one dispersed them. At first I thought it was a demonstration - but no, they were simply enjoying themselves. Roasted chestnuts were being sold. Rain began to fall. The grass in the Luxembourg gardens was a tender green. In December! I was very hot in my lined coat. (I had left my boots and fur cap at the hotel.) There were bright posters everywhere. All the time I felt as though I were at the theatre. I have lived in Paris off and on for many years. Various events, snatches of conversation have become confused in my memory. But I remember well my first day there: the city electrified my. The most astonishing thing is that is has remained unchanged; Moscow is unrecognizable, but Paris is still as it was. When I come to Paris now, I feel inexpressibly sad - the city is the same, it is I who have changed. It is painful for me to walk along the familiar streets - they are the streets of my youth. Of course, the fiacres, the omnibuses, the steam-car disappeared long ago; you rarely see a cafÃ© with red velvet or leather settees; only a few pissoirs are left - the rest have gone into hiding underground. But these, after all, are minor details. People still live out in the streets, lovers kiss wherever they please, no one takes any notice of anyone. The old houses haven't changed - what's another half a century to them; at their age it makes no difference. Say what you will, the world has changed, and so the Parisians, too, must be thinking of many things of which they had no inkling in the old days: the atom bomb, mass-production methods, Communism. But with their new thoughts they still remain Parisians, and I am sure that if an eighteen-year-old Soviet lad comes to Paris today he will raise his hands in astonishment, as I did in 1908: "A theatre! - Ilya Ehrenburg, People, Years and Life
The reality is that many of us in these parts are not enamored of Paris." The Commandant gulped down his coffee. "I worked there as a young officer in the CRS, the riot squad. I speak from personal experience. Paris is bizarre. Paris is a museum surrounded by a jungle. - Sebastian Rotella

Almost immediately after jazz musicians arrived in Paris, they began to gather in two of the city's most important creative neighborhoods: Montmartre and Montparnasse, respectively the Right and Left Bank haunts of artists, intellectuals, poets, and musicians since the late nineteenth century. Performing in these high-profile and popular entertainment districts could give an advantage to jazz musicians because Parisians and tourists already knew to go there when they wanted to spend a night out on the town. As hubs of artistic imagination and experimentation, Montmartre and Montparnasse therefore attracted the kinds of audiences that might appreciate the new and thrilling sounds of jazz. For many listeners, these locations leant the music something of their own exciting aura, and the early success of jazz in Paris probably had at least as much to do with musicians playing there as did other factors.In spite of their similarities, however, by the 1920s these neighborhoods were on two very different paths, each representing competing visions of what France could become after the war. And the reactions to jazz in each place became important markers of the difference between the two areas and visions. Montmartre was legendary as the late-nineteenth-century capital of â€œbohemian Paris,â€ where French artists had gathered and cabaret songs had filled the air. In its heyday, Montmartre was one of the centers of popular entertainment, and its artists prided themselves on flying in the face of respectable middle-class values. But by the 1920s, Montmartre represented an established artistic tradition, not the challenge to bourgeois life that it had been at the fin de siÃ¨cle. Entertainment culture was rapidly changing both in substance and style in the postwar era, and a desire for new sounds, including foreign music and exotic art, was quickly replacing the love for the cabarets' French chansons. Jazz was not entirely to blame for such changes, of course. Commercial pressures, especially the rapidly growing tourist trade, eroded the popularity of old Montmartre cabarets, which were not always able to compete with the newer music halls and dance halls. Yet jazz bore much of the criticism from those who saw the changes in Montmartre as the death of French popular entertainment. Montparnasse, on the other hand, was the face of a modern Paris. It was the international crossroads where an ever changing mixture of people celebrated, rather than lamented, cosmopolitanism and exoticism in all its forms, especially in jazz bands. These different attitudes within the entertainment districts and their institutions reflected the impact of the broader trends at work in Parisâ€”the influx of foreign populations, for example, or the advent of cars and electricity on city streets as indicators of modern technologyâ€”and the possible consequences for French culture. Jazz was at the confluence of these trends, and it became a convenient symbol for the struggle they represented. - Jeffrey H. Jackson, Making Jazz French: Music and Modern Life in Interwar Paris

How long since you had sex?â€ Aeron asked his friend.  Another moan. â€œTwoâ€”three days.â€ Paris wiped his mouth with the back of his wrist.  Which meant Paris hadnâ€Ÿt had a female since before their return. But Aeron knew Lucien had flashed the warrior into town every night theyâ€Ÿd spent in the desert for just that reason.

This is what you British do not understand about the French.

They make people work on Sundays! And through lunchtimes! But for what? For rubbish from China? For cheap clothes sewed by poor women in Malaysia? For why? So you can go more often to KFC and get full of fried chicken? You would rather have six bars of bad chocolate than one bar of good chocolate. Why? Why are six bad things better than one good thing?

She had to lift both hands to illustrate what she meant, but he just let her carry his hand with her, not about to let go. She pushed the free hand toward the one he held, apparently trying to gesture closeness. "Warm," she said again. And then she did something that undid him to the last faint whisper of his soul: she gave his hand a squeeze with fingertips that could just barely reach around his, apparently using him to indicate what she wanted to say. He meant warmth. He meant this word she couldn't find. - Laura Florand, The Chocolate Touch
My wife and I had called on Miss Stein, and she and the friend who lived with her had been very cordial and friendly and we had loved the big studio with the great paintings. I t was like one of the best rooms in the finest museum except there was a big fireplace and it was warm and comfortable and they gave you good things to eat and tea and natural distilled liqueurs made from purple plums, yellow plums or wild raspberries.Miss Stein was very big but not tall and was heavily built like a peasant woman. She had beautiful eyes and a strong German-Jewish face that also could have been Friulano and she reminded me of a northern I talian peasant woman with her clothes, her mobile face and her lovely, thick, alive immigrant hair which she wore put up in the same way she had probably worn it in college. She talked all the time and at first it was about people and places.Her companion had a very pleasant voice, was small, very dark, with her hair cut like Joan of Arc in the Boutet de Monvel illustrations and had a very hooked nose. She was working on a piece of needlepoint when we first met them and she worked on this and saw to the food and drink and talked to my wife. She made one conversation and listened to two and often interrupted the one she was not making. Afterwards she explained to me that she always talked to the wives. The wives, my wife and I felt, were tolerated. But we liked Miss Stein and her friend, although the friend was frightening. The paintings and the cakes and the eau-de-vie were truly wonderful. They seemed to like us too and treated us as though we were very good, well-mannered and promising children and I felt that they forgave us for being in love and being married - time would fix that - and when my wife invited them to tea, they accepted. - Ernest Hemingway, A Moveable Feast: The Restored Edition

The blue-backed notebooks, the two pencils and the pencil sharpener (a pocket knife was too wasteful) the marble-topped tables, the smell of early morning, sweeping out and mopping, and luck were all you needed. For luck you carried a horse chestnut and a rabbit's foot in your right pocket. The fur had been worn off the rabbit's foot long ago and the bones and the sinews were polished by wear. The claws scratched in the lining of your pocket and you knew your luck was still there. - Ernest Hemingway, A Moveable Feast: The Restored Edition
The street sprinkler went past and, as its rasping rotary broom spread water over the tarmac, half the pavement looked as if it had been painted with a dark stain. A big yellow dog had mounted a tiny white bitch who stood quite still.In the fashion of colonials the old gentleman wore a light jacket, almost white, and a straw hat.Everything held its position in space as if prepared for an apotheosis. In the sky the towers of Notre-Dame gathered about themselves a nimbus of heat, and the sparrows â€“ minor actors almost invisible from the street â€“ made themselves at home high up among the gargoyles. A string of barges drawn by a tug with a white and red pennant had crossed the breadth of Paris and the tug lowered its funnel, either in salute or to pass under the Pont Saint-Louis.Sunlight poured down rich and luxuriant, fluid and gilded as oil, picking out highlights on the Seine, on the pavement dampened by the sprinkler, on a dormer window, and on a tile roof on the ÃŽle Saint-Louis. A mute, overbrimming life flowed from each inanimate thing, shadows were violet as in impressionist canvases, taxis redder on the white bridge, buses greener.A faint breeze set the leaves of a chestnut tree trembling, and all down the length of the quai there rose a palpitation which drew voluptuously nearer and nearer to become a refreshing breath fluttering the engravings pinned to the booksellers' stalls.People had come from far away, from the four corners of the earth, to live that one moment. Sightseeing cars were lined up on the parvis of Notre-Dame, and an agitated little man was talking through a megaphone.Nearer to the old gentleman, to the bookseller dressed in black, an American student contemplated the universe through the view-finder of his Leica.Paris was immense and calm, almost silent, with her sheaves of light, her expanses of shadow in just the right places, her sounds which penetrated the silence at just the right moment.The old gentleman with the light-coloured jacket had opened a portfolio filled with coloured prints and, the better to look at them, propped up the portfolio on the stone parapet.The American student wore a red checked shirt and was coatless.The bookseller on her folding chair moved her lips without looking at her customer, to whom she was speaking in a tireless stream. That was all doubtless part of the symphony. She was knitting. Red wool slipped through her fingers.The white bitch's spine sagged beneath the weight of the big male, whose tongue was hanging out.And then when everything was in its place, when the perfection of that particular morning reached an almost frightening point, the old gentleman died without saying a word, without a cry, without a contortion while he was looking at his coloured prints, listening to the voice of the bookseller as it ran on and on, to the cheeping of the sparrows, the occasional horns of taxis.He must have died standing up, one elbow on the stone ledge, a total lack of astonishment in his blue eyes. He swayed and fell to the pavement, dragging along with him the portfolio with all its prints scattered about him.The male dog wasn't at all frightened, never stopped. The woman let her ball of wool fall from her lap and stood up suddenly, crying out:â€˜Monsieur Bouvet! - Georges Simenon
Have you ever been to Paris before?" I asked Kylian."No, though from what I've seen, I'm sure it's worth a trip.

As the shabby section of the audience rose to its feet, waving its hats and food-wrappers, a rich, stale smell wafted through the auditorium. It had something of the fog on the boulevard outside, where the pavements were sticky with rain, but also something more intimate : it suggested old stew and course tobacco, the coat racks and bookshelves of a pawnshop, and damp straw mattresses impregnated with urine and patchouli. It was - as though the set designer had intended some ironical epilogue - the smell of the real Latin Quarter. - Graham Robb, Parisians: An Adventure History of Paris
In those days, long before, a view over the rooftops of Paris was an unaffordable luxury. The apartment he had shared with a mousy young writer from Laon had a view of the Jardin de Luxembourg â€“ if he stuck his head out of the window as far as it would go and twisted it to the left, a smudge of green foliage appeared in the corner of one eye. That had been his best apartment to date. They had decorated it in the â€˜Bohemian' style of the 1830s : a few volumes of Shakespeare and Victor Hugo, a Phrygian cap, an Algerian hookah, a skull on a broomstick handle (from the brother of a friend, Charles Toubin, who was an intern at one of the big hospitals) and, of course, a window box of geraniums, which was not only pretty but also illegal. (Death by falling window box was always high up the official list of fatalities.) For a proper view of Paris, they visited Henry's painter friends who lived in a warren of attic rooms near the Barriere d'Enfer and called themselves the Water-Drinkers. When the weather was fine and the smell of their own squalor became unbearable, they clambered onto the roof and sat on the gutters and ridges, sketching chimneyscapes, and sending up more smoke from their pipes than the fireplaces below.Three of the Water-Drinkers had since died of various illnesses known collectively as â€˜lack of money'. When the last of the three was buried, in the spring of 1844, Henry and the others had found themselves at the graveside without a sou to give a gravedigger. â€˜Never mind', said he, â€œyou can pay me the next time, â€˜ and then, to his collegue : â€˜It's all right â€“ these gentlemen are a regular customers. - Graham Robb, Parisians: An Adventure History of Paris
The sun finally died in beauty, flinging out its crimson flames, which cast their reflection on the faces of passers-by, giving them a strangely feverish look. The darkness of the trees became deeper. You could hear the Seine flowing. Sounds carried farther, and people in their beds could feel, as they did every night, the vibration of the ground as buses rolled past. - Georges Simenon, L'Enterrement de Monsieur Bouvet
... Paris was a city of love for unimaginative folks. - Lauren Morrill, Meant to Be
If I walked down by different streets to the Jardin du Luxembourg in the afternoon I could walk through the gardens and then go to the MusÃ©e du Luxembourg where the great paintings were that have now mostly been transferred to the Louvre and the Jeu de Paume. I went there nearly every day for the CÃ©zannes and to see the Manets and the Monets and the other Impressionists that I had first come to know about in the Art Institute at Chicago. I was learning something from the painting of CÃ©zanne that made writing simple true sentences far from enough to make the stories have the dimensions that I was trying to put in them. I was learning very much from him but I was not articulate enough to explain it to anyone. Besides it was a secret. But if the light was gone in the Luxembourg I would walk up through the gardens and stop in at the studio apartment where Gertrude Stein lived at 27 rue de Fleurus. - Ernest Hemingway, A Moveable Feast: The Restored Edition

For example, in Paris, if one desires to buy something, you enter the store and say "Good morning, sir" or "madam," depending on what is appropriate, you wait until you are greeted, you make polite chitchat about the weather or some such, and when the salesperson asks what they can do for you, then and only then do you bring up the vulgar business of the transaction you require. - Craig Ferguson, Between the Bridge and the River
HÃ©lÃ¨ne, her eyes once more raised and remote, was deep in a dream. She was Lady Rowena, she was in love, with the deep peaceful passion of a noble soul.

You'd think the sight of beautiful Place VendÃ´me would lift my spirits but oddly the arc of jewellery - so obviously beyond the means of a jobless person like me - only depresses me more.

Sandrine opened her eyes to the soft gray light of early dawn. Recollections of sensual pleasure seemed to caress her body, bringing a smile to her lips. She lay back in the pillow and listened to the breathing of Philippe beside her. She lingered in the memory of the previous night, a memory that was like a warm and tender embrace, an evening of small intimate harmonies. As it should be. - Paul A. Myers, Paris 1934: Victory in Retreat
Out of the corner of his eye, he saw another woman sitting over in a wing chair, a pleasantly attractive lady wearing the tasteful clothes of a senior redactrice, or senior civil servant, the stylish black skirt, the dark stockings, the black pumps, and the starched white linen blouse of her caste. The dark hair was swept up in a chignon, elegant and functional, dark eyes glistened as she smiled at him in a professional manner. He could see that she was a woman who met men in a highly assured wayâ€”serene, and expert at creating a proper distance. - Paul A. Myers, Paris 1935: Destiny's Crossroads
In Paris, you couldn't really turn around without seeing the result of lovers' bad decisions. An artist given to sexual excess was almost a clichÃ©, but no one seemed to mind.

Night came on, the lamps were lighted, the tables near him found occupants, and Paris began to wear that peculiar evening look of hers which seems to say, in the flare of windows and theatre-doors, and the muffled rumble of swift-rolling carriages, that this is no world for you unless you have your pockets lined and your scruples drugged. - Henry James, Madame de Mauves

High towers, and metaphysically-great men resembling them, round both of which there is commonly much wind, are not for me. My place is the fruitful bathos, the bottom-land, of experience; and the word transcendental, does not signify something passing beyond all experience, but something that indeed precedes it a priori, but that is intended simply to make cognition of experience possible. - Immanuel Kant, Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics
And further, observing that all this indeterminate substance is in motion, and that no true predication can be made of that which changes, they supposed that it is impossible to make any true statement about that which is in all ways and entirely changeable. For it was from this supposition that there blossomed forth the most extreme view of those which we have mentioned, that of the professed followers of Heraclitus, and such as Cratylus held, who ended by thinking that one need not say anything, and only moved his finger; and who criticized Heraclitus for saying that one cannot enter the same river twice, for he himself held that it cannot be done even once. - Aristotle

There was a metal rod inside of Colin. The rod went from his stomach to the middle of his head.

It must be *possible* for the *I think* to accompany all my representations: for otherwise something would be represented within me that could not be thought at all, in other words, the representation would either be impossible, or at least would be nothing to me. That representation which can be given prior to all thought is called *intuition*, and all the manifold of intuition has, therefore, a necessary relation to the *I think* in the same subject in which this manifold of intuition is found. This representation (the *I think*), however, is an act of *spontaneity*, that is, it cannot be considered as belonging to sensibility. I call it *pure apperception*, in order to distinguish it from empirical apperception, as also from original apperception, because it is that self-consciousness which, by producing the representations, *I think* (which must be capable of accompanying all other representations, and which is one and the same in all consciousness), cannot itself be accompanied by any further representations. I also call the unity of apperception the *transcendental* unity of self-consciousness, in order to indicate that *a priori* knowledge can be obtained from it. For the manifold representations given in an intuition would not one and all be *my* representations, if they did not all belong to one self-consciousness. What I mean is that, as my representations (even though I am not conscious of them as that), they must conform to the condition under which alone they *can* stand together in one universal self-consciousness, because otherwise they would not one and all belong to me. From this original combination much can be inferred.The thoroughgoing identity of the apperception of a manifold that is given in intuition contains a synthesis of representations, and is possible only through the consciousness of this synthesis. For the empirical consciousness which accompanies different representations is itself dispersed and without reference to the identity of the subject. Such a reference comes about, not simply through my accompanying every representation with consciousness, but through my *adding* one representation to another and being conscious of the synthesis of them. Only because I am able to combine a manifold of given representations *in one consciousness* is it possible for me to represent to myself the *identity of the consciousness in these representations*, that is, only under the presupposition of some *synthetic* unity of apperception is the *analytic* unity of apperception possible. The thought that the representations given in intuition belong one and all *to me*, is therefore the same as the thought that I unite them in one self-consciousness, or can at least do so; and although that thought itself is not yet the consciousness of the synthesis of representations, it nevertheless presupposes the possibility of this synthesis. In other words, it is only because I am able to comprehend the manifold of representations in one consciousness that I call them one and all *my* representations. For otherwise I should have as many-coloured and varied a self as I have representations of which I am conscious. Synthetic unity of the manifold of intuitions, as given *a priori*, is thus the ground of the identity of apperception itself, which precedes *a priori* all *my* determinate thought. Combination, however, does not lie in the objects, and cannot be borrowed from them by perception and thus first be taken into the understanding. It is, rather, solely an act of the understanding, which itself is nothing but the faculty of combining *a priori* and of bringing the manifold of given representations under the unity of apperception; and the principle of this unity is, in fact, the supreme principle of all human knowledge."â€”from_Critique of Pure Reason_. Translated, edited, and with an Introduction by Marcus Weigelt, based on the translation by Max MÃ¼ller, pp. 124-128 - Immanuel Kant
It is true, no doubt, that this principle of the necessary unity of apperception is itself an identical and therefore an analytic proposition; but it shows, nevertheless, the necessity of a synthesis of the manifold given in an intuition, a synthesis without which it would be impossible to think the thoroughgoing identity of self-consciousness. For through the *I*, as a simple representation, nothing manifold is given; only in intuition, which is distinct from this representation, can a manifold be given, and then, through *combination*, be thought in one consciousness. An understanding in which through self-consciousness all the manifold would be given at the same time would be one that *intuits*; our understanding can do nothing but *think*, and must seek intuition in the senses. I am conscious, therefore, of the identical self with respect to the manifold of the representations that are given to me in an intuition, because I call them one and all *my* representations, as constituting *one* intuition. This means that I am conscious *a priori* of a necessary synthesis of them, which is called the original synthetic unity of apperception, and under which all representations given to me must stand, but under which they must also be brought by means of a synthesis.â€â€”from_Critique of Pure Reason_. Translated, edited, and with an Introduction by Marcus Weigelt, based on the translation by Max MÃ¼ller, pp. 128-129 - Immanuel Kant
In consequence of the inevitably scattered and fragmentary nature of our thinking, which has been mentioned, and of the mixing together of the most heterogeneous representations thus brought about and inherent even in the noblest human mind, we really possess only *half a consciousness*. With this we grope about in the labyrinth of our life and in the obscurity of our investigations; bright moments illuminate our path like flashes of lighting. But what is to be expected generally from heads of which even the wisest is every night the playground of the strangest and most senseless dreams, and has to take up its meditations again on emerging from these dreams? Obviously a consciousness subject to such great limitations is little fitted to explore and fathom the riddle of the world; and to beings of a higher order, whose intellect did not have time as its form, and whose thinking therefore had true completeness and unity, such an endeavor would necessarily appear strange and pitiable. In fact, it is a wonder that we are not completely confused by the extremely heterogeneous mixture of fragments of representations and of ideas of every kind which are constantly crossing one another in our heads, but that we are always able to find our way again, and to adapt and adjust everything. Obviously there must exist a simple thread on which everything is arranged side by side: but what is this? Memory alone is not enough, since it has essential limitations of which I shall shortly speak; moreover, it is extremely imperfect and treacherous. The *logical ego*, or even the *transcendental synthetic unity of apperception*, are expressions and explanations that will not readily serve to make the matter comprehensible; on the contrary, it will occur to many thatâ€œYour wards are deftly wrought, but drive no bolts asunder.â€Kant's proposition: â€œThe *I think* must accompany all our representations ,â€ is insufficient; for the â€œIâ€ is an unknown quantity, in other words, it is itself a mystery and a secret. What gives unity and sequence to consciousness, since by pervading all the representations of consciousness, it is its substratum, its permanent supporter, cannot itself be conditioned by consciousness, and therefore cannot be a representation. On the contrary, it must be the *prius* of consciousness, and the root of the tree of which consciousness is the fruit. This, I say, is the *will*; it alone is unalterable and absolutely identical, and has brought forth consciousness for its own ends. It is therefore the will that gives unity and holds all its representations and ideas together, accompanying them, as it were, like a continuous ground-bass. Without it the intellect would have no more unity of consciousness than has a mirror, in which now one thing now another presents itself in succession, or at most only as much as a convex mirror has, whose rays converge at an imaginary point behind its surface. But it is *the will* alone that is permanent and unchangeable in consciousness. It is the will that holds all ideas and representations together as means to its ends, tinges them with the colour of its character, its mood, and its interest, commands the attention, and holds the thread of motives in its hand. The influence of these motives ultimately puts into action memory and the association of ideas. Fundamentally it is the will that is spoken of whenever â€œIâ€ occurs in a judgement. Therefore, the will is the true and ultimate point of unity of consciousness, and the bond of all its functions and acts. It does not, however, itself belong to the intellect, but is only its root, origin, and controller."â€”from_The World as Will and Representation_. Translated from the German by E. F. J. Payne in two volumes: volume II, pp. 139-140 - Arthur Schopenhauer
Philosophy in its old form could exist only in the absence of engineering, but with engineering in existence and daily more active and far reaching, the old verbalistic philosophy and metaphysics have lost their reason to exist. They were no more able to understand the "production" of the universe and life than they are now able to understand or grapple with "production" as a means to provide a happier existence for humanity. They failed because their venerated method of "speculation" can not produce, and its place must be taken by mathematical thinking. Mathematical reasoning is displacing metaphysical reasoning. Engineering is driving verbalistic philosophy out of existence and humanity gains decidedly thereby. Only a few parasites and "speculators" will mourn the disappearance of their old companion "speculation." The world of producers -the predominating majority of human beings- will welcome a philosophy of ordered thought and production. - Alfred Korzybski, Manhood of Humanity
Ontically, of course, Dasein is not only close to usâ€•even that which is closest: we *are* it, each of us, we ourselves. In spite of this, or rather for just this reason, it is ontologically that which is farthest. To be sure, its ownmost Being is such that it has an understanding of that Being, and already maintains itself in each case as if its Being has been interpreted in some manner. But we are certainly not saying that when Dasein's own Being is thus interpreted pre-ontologically in the way which lies closest, this interpretation can be taken over as an appropriate clue, as if this way of understanding Being is what must emerge when one's ownmost state of Being is considered as an ontological theme. The kind of Being which belongs to Dasein is rather such that, in understanding its own Being, it has a tendency to do so in terms of that entity towards which it comports itself proximally and in a way which is essentially constantâ€•in terms of the 'world'. In Dasein itself, and therefore in its own understanding of Being, the way the world is understood is, as we shall show, reflected back ontologically upon the way in which Dasein itself gets interpreted.Thus because Dasein is ontico-ontologically prior, its own specific state of Being (if we understand this in the sense of Dasein's 'categorial structure') remains concealed from it. Dasein is ontically 'closest' to itself and ontologically farthest; but pre-ontologically it is surely not a stranger."â€•from_Being and Time_. Translated by John Macquarrie & Edward Robinson, pp. 36-37 - Martin Heidegger
He is romanticâ€”romantic,â€ he repeated. â€œAnd that is very badâ€”very bad. . . . Very good, too,â€ he added. â€œBut is he?â€ I queried.â€˜â€œGewiss,â€ he said, and stood still holding up the candelabrum, but without looking at me. â€œEvident! What is it that by inward pain makes him know himself? What is it that for you and me makes himâ€”exist?â€â€˜At that moment it was difficult to believe in Jim's existenceâ€”starting from a country parsonage, blurred by crowds of men as by clouds of dust, silenced by the clashing claims of life and death in a material worldâ€”but his imperishable reality came to me with a convincing, with an irresistible force! I saw it vividly, as though in our progress through the lofty silent rooms amongst fleeting gleams of light and the sudden revelations of human figures stealing with flickering flames within unfathomable and pellucid depths, we had approached nearer to absolute Truth, which, like Beauty itself, floats elusive, obscure, half submerged, in the silent still waters of mystery. â€œPerhaps he is,â€ I admitted with a slight laugh, whose unexpectedly loud reverberation made me lower my voice directly; â€œbut I am sure you are.â€ With his head dropping on his breast and the light held high he began to walk again. â€œWellâ€”I exist, too,â€ he said. - Joseph Conrad, Lord Jim

And just as the same town, when looked at from different sides, appears quite different and is, as it were, multiplied in perspective, so also it happens that because of the infinite number of simple substances, it is as if there were as many different universes, which are however but different perspective representations of a single universe form the different point of view of each monad. - Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, Monadology
I have been considering the possibility that the facts that can be ascertained about this cheese fail to satisfy because the facts themselves mask a metaphysical truth that can be known only through the transcendent, poetic expression of the cheddar. That is, though the world itself can never truly be known, one might begin to know some truth about the world through a metaphysical cheese - Mark Beauregard, The Whale: A Love Story
Philosophically literate anthropomorphism is exactly what one would expect of any worldview which affirms that human beings are made in the image o - Eleanore Stump
Can you really believe that a drop of urine is an infinity of monads, and that each of these has ideas, however obscure, of the universe as a whole? - Voltaire, Å’uvres complÃ¨tes - 109 titres et annexes
Wisdom plus knowledge equals understanding. - Reid A. Ashbaucher, Made in the Image of God:  Understanding the Nature of God and mankind in a Changing World
Once I knew, then I forgot. It was as if I had fallen asleep in a field only to discover at waking that a grove of trees had grown up around me. â€œDoubt nothing, believe everything,â€ was my friend's idea of metaphysics, although his brother ran away with his wife. He still bought her a rose every day, sat in the empty house for the next twenty years talking to her about the weather. I was already dozing off in the shade, dreaming that the rustling trees were my many selves explaining themselves all at the same time so that I could not make out a single word. My life was a beautiful mystery on the verge of understanding, always on the verge! Think of it! My friend's empty house with every one of its windows lit. The dark trees multiplying all around it. - Charles Simic, The World Doesn't End
Being is always becoming -  people change and stay the same.
Scientifically, just because the spiritual person can manifest a drink of coffee, does not mean that he or she knows how it happens! - Richard Gentle, Quantum Mass Superstructures
Heidegger is the philosopher to whom especially postmodernists chiefly appeal in their radical rejections of metaphysics and of any and every conception of the entirety of actuality, of Being as such and as a whole. To be sure, their appeals to Heidegger are as a rule extraordinarily superficial ones. These authors come nowhere near to providing adequate interpretations of or appropriations from Heid - Lorenz B. Puntel
It is true, there could be a metaphysical world; the absolute possibility of it is hardly to be disputed. We behold all things through the human head and cannot cut off this head; while the question nonetheless remains what of the world would still be there if one had cut it off. - Friedrich Nietzsche, Human, All Too Human
If an evil spirit had to hide from God, it would hide in a diamond. If an angel had to hide from the Devil, it would hide in rose quartz. - Suzy Kassem, Rise Up and Salute the Sun: The Writings of Suzy Kassem
For seven centuries the existence of Grand Unification Theories and hyperstring post-quantum physics and Core-given understanding of the universe as self-contained and boundless, without Big Bang singularities or corresponding endpoints, had pretty much eliminated any role of Godâ€”primitively anthropomorphic or sophisticatedly post-Einsteinianâ€”even as a caretaker or pre-Creation former of rules. The modern universe, as machine and man had come to understand it, needed no Creator; in fact, allowed no Creator. Its rules allowed very little tinkering and no major revisions. It had not begun and would not end, beyond cycles of expansion and contraction as regular and self-regulated as the seasons on Old Earth - Dan Simmons, The Fall of Hyperion
A witch is a woman who emerges from deep within herself. She is a woman who has honestly explored her light and learned to celebrate her darkness. She is a woman who is able to fall in love with the magnificent possibilities of her power. She is a woman who radiates mystery. She is magnetic. She is a witch. - Dacha Avelin
The term 'Being' does not define that realm of entities which is uppermost when these are articulated conceptually according to genus and species: the 'universality' of Being 'transcends' any universality of genus. - Martin Heidegger, Being and Time
Notice that your judgments of what exists are the same kind of judgments you make about how to live your life. There aren't two kinds of things we do: judge what exists and decide what we want to do about it. Fundamentally, there is one kind of thing we do: live our lives. And we can reflect on this activity more or less abstractly. - Eric Kaplan, Does Santa Exist?: A Philosophical Investigation
When you decide to appreciate something, no matter how subtle, you absolutely do pivot and shift your vibration significantly. - Debbianne DeRose, How I Met the Man of My Dreams: a guide to MANifesting yours
Your manifesting results comprise a chain with a zillion tiny linksâ€”moments, experiences, conversations, physical objects, and coinciding eventsâ€”all leading up to what you'd consider "the finished product" or the goal achieved. Be open to recognizing and appreciating every link. Normally the mind glosses, or even steamrollers, over them, discounting them as stupid, unimportant, too-little-too-late, irrelevant or uninteresting. - Debbianne DeRose, Manifesting for Simpletons: a 30-Day Outrageously Simple Guide to Gettin' the Goods
But had Minkowski and Einstein not recognized it long before us, our schizophrenic children would have taught us that space-time is a unity that precedes any separate understanding of either category; just as grasping this unity is a precondition for understanding causality. - Bruno Bettelheim, Empty Fortress
Jo knew nothing about philosophy or metaphysics of any sort, but a curious excitement, half pleasurable, half painful, came over her, as she listened with a sense of being turned adrift into time and space, like a young balloon out on a holiday. - Louisa May Alcott, Little Women
In periods when shallow speculation is rife, one might think that metaphysics would shine forth, at least, by the brilliance of its modest reserve. But the very age that is unaware of the majesty of metaphysics, likewise overlooks its poverty. Its majesty? It is wisdom. Its poverty? It is human science. - Jacques Maritain
Everything in the seen world is a dim reflection or representation of the unseen world. - Dan   Pedersen, The Higher Life: An Inner Presence
We may hop when the gods say 'frog,' but we still get to choose how fast and how high. - Katherine Lampe, The Unquiet Grave
No matter how you arrive at the awareness and belief that you've lived before and will live again, the most lasting healing benefit will be the change in your attitude. You are creating your future lives right at this moment, and every moment of decision-making. - Lianne Downey, Speed Your Evolution: Become the Star Being You Are Meant to Be
In reality, mankind is still metaphysically in God's likeness, butGod's image in mankind has been altered by sin. We can no longerduplicate or reflect God's attitudes as we once could do. That is, we canno longer be holy as God is holy. Our morality has been altered and nolonger has the capability to duplicate or reflect God's image. So what isthe answer? Can this image be repaired or made whole again? The answeris, YES! - Reid A. Ashbaucher, Made in the Image of God: Understanding the Nature of God and Mankind in a Changing World
The type of nothing from which something can arise is truly something. - John K.  Brown
Comrades in the struggle! The position of modern man is not merely lamentable; one might even say that there is no condition, because man hardly exists. Nothing exists to which one could point and say: 'There, that is Homo Zapiens.' HZ is simply the residual luminescence of a soul fallen asleep; it is a film about the shooting of another film, shown on a television in an empty house. - Victor Pelevin, Homo Zapiens
The accusation of metaphysics has become in philosophy something like the accusation of being a security risk in the public service. I do not for my part know what is meant by the word 'metaphysics'. The only definition I have found that fits all cases is: 'a philosophical opinion not held by the present author'. - Bertrand Russell, My Philosophical Development
To bracket form and finality out of one's investigations as far as reason allows is a matter of method, but to deny their reality altogether is a matter of metaphysics. - David Bentley Hart, The Experience of God: Being, Consciousness, Bliss
...being aware that the sacred quality hidden in the experience of eroticism is something impossible for language to reach (this is also due to the impossibility of experiencing of re-experiencing anything through language), Bataille still expresses it in words. (Mishima on Bataille) - Georges Bataille, My Mother/Madame Edwarda/The Dead Man
Attaining consciousness is connected with the gradual liberation from mechanicalness, for man is fully and completely under mechanical laws. - P.D. Ouspensky, The Fourth Way
But you don't really mean to say that you couldn't love me if my name wasn't Ernest?GWENDOLEN: But your name is Ernest.JACK: Yes, I know it is. But supposing it was something else? Do you mean to say you couldn't love me - Oscar Wilde, The Importance of Being Earnest
Man lives on earth not once, but three times: the first stage of his life is his continual sleep; the second, sleeping and waking by turns; the third, waking forever. - Gustav Fechner
Perception is the illusion that gives all matter mass," The Flight of the Eagle A.K. Luthienne - A.K. Luthienne, Flight of the Eagle
To deny the necessity or value of metaphysics is to assert a metaphysical principle, just as to say a religion must be without dogmas is to assert a dogma. - Fulton J. Sheen, Philosophy of Science
God is triune, and all reality is structured in terms of Him. A brief definition of the Trinity might be this: One God without division in a plurality of Persons, and three Persons without confusion in a unity of essence. God is not 'basically' One, with the individual Persons being derived from the oneness; nor is God 'basically' Three, with the unity of the Persons being secondary. God is One, and God is Three. There are not three Gods; there is only one God. Yet each of the Persons is Himself God â€” and They are distinct, individual Persons. But there is only one God. "To put it in more philosophical language, God's unity (oneness) and diversity (threeness, individuality) are equally ultimate. God is 'basically' One and 'basically' Three at the same time. And the same goes for all of creation. Both unity and diversity are important â€“ equally important. Neither aspect of reality has priority over the other. - David H. Chilton
...knowing about your past lives is worse than useless if that knowledge doesn't bring you some kind of positive change or healing. - Lianne Downey, Speed Your Evolution: Become the Star Being You Are Meant to Be
Derridaâ€¦ labels as â€˜metaphysical' any such thought system which depends on an unassailable foundation, a first principle or unimpeachable ground upon which a whole hierarchy of meanings may be constructed. It is not that he believes that we can merely rid ourselves of the urge to forge such first principles, for such an impulse is deeply embedded in our history, and cannot â€” at least as yet â€” be eradicated or ignored. Derrida would see his own work as inescapably â€˜contaminated' by such metaphysical thought, much as he strives to give it the slip. But if you examine such first principles closely, you can see that they may always be â€˜deconstructed': they can be shown to be products of a particular system of meaning, rather than what props it up from the outside. - Terry Eagleton, Literary Theory: An Introduction
My metaphysical thinking is more in alignment with Plato rather than Aristotle's." ~R. Alan Woods [2013] - R. Alan Woods, The Journey Is the Destination: A Book of Quotes With Commentaries
Historically mystics have claimed that for a true understanding of reality metaphysics is too â€œscientificâ€. Metaphysics is not reality. Metaphysics is names about reality. Metaphysics is a restaurant where they give you a thirty-thousand-page menu and no food. - Robert M. Pirsig
Knowlede is power and Absolute Knowledge is Absolute Power or the Power of Truth, which is constantly shaping events and circumstances to reveal the errors in our beliefs. - Matthew A. Petti, The Metaphysics of Truth -Unobserved Realities and the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse
The Truth is always trying to reveal itslef to us in our physical world. - Matthew A. Petti, The Metaphysics of Truth -Unobserved Realities and the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse
There is so much more than we can see, there is so much more that we can be. - Tom Kenyon M.A.
If you don't break your ropes while you're alive, do you think ghosts will do it after? - Kabir
Serenity comes from the ability to say â€œYesâ€ to existence. Courage comes from the ability to say â€œNoâ€ to the wrong choices made by others. - Ayn Rand, Philosophy: Who Needs It
God who gave Animals self motion beyond our understanding is without doubt able to implant other principles of motion in bodies [which] we may understand as little. Some would readily grant this may be a Spiritual one; yet a mechanical one might be showne, did not I think it better to pass it by. - Isaac Newton, The Correspondence of Isaac Newton: Published for the Royal Society. VOLUMES 1 through 7
Do not commit spiritual suicide through a passion for discussing metaphysical subtleties. - Charles Haddon Spurgeon, All of Grace
For one to define and understand the nature of the universe, one must firstunderstand the nature of the force behind its existence. - Reid A. Ashbaucher, Made in the Image of God: Understanding the Nature of God and Mankind in a Changing World
Attitude is a state of mind that results in an action taken or anemotion displayed. Attitude, in the end, is a motivator or that whichgenerates or reflects motives. - Reid A. Ashbaucher, Made in the Image of God: Understanding the Nature of God and Mankind in a Changing World
I knew in that moment, we were never meant to surrender our childlike innocence, to trade a world in which we fit like a glove for one that hung on us like ill-fitting hand-me-downs. However, all about us insisted on our membership. And instead of a handshake or a mystical password as entrance into this spurious society, we agreed instead to share a lie, the one that says we're safe, secure, and fulfilled living this way. - Christina Carson, Dying to Know
That afternoon She listened to the grievances of the dead from two warring nations. Both sides had suffered, both sides had legitimate grievances, both pled their cases earnestly. She covered Her ears and moaned in misery. She knew Her humans were multidimensional and She could no longer live under the rigid architecture of Her youthful choices. - David Eagleman, Sum: Forty Tales from the Afterlives
It was a wonderful experience. She mistrusted his very slumbers--and she seemed to think I could tell her why! Thus a poor mortal seduced by the charm of an apparition might have tried to wring from another ghost the tremendous secret of the claim the other world holds over a disembodied soul astray amongst the passions of this earth. The very ground on which I stood seemed to melt under my feet. And it was so simple too; but if the spirits evoked by our fears and our unrest have ever to vouch for each other's constancy before the forlorn magicians that we are, then I--I alone of us dwellers in the flesh--have shuddered in the hopeless chill of such a task. - Joseph Conrad
So live. I'll be the nun for you. I am now. - Annie Dillard, Holy the Firm
To understand an issue or someone's argument about anything,one needs to understand the very nature of the issue, which is thefoundational question concerning anything. - Reid A. Ashbaucher, Made in the Image of God: Understanding the Nature of God and Mankind in a Changing World
Walk tall, or baby don't walk at all. - Bruce Springsteen
There is only one real misfortune: to forfeit one's own good opinion of oneself. Lose your complacency, once betray your own self-contempt and the world will unhesitatingly endorse it. - Thomas Mann
Respect yourself enough to walk away from anything that no longer serves you, grows you, or makes you happy. - Robert Tew
A quest for self-respect is proof of its lack - Ayn Rand, The Fountainhead
You got nothin' to lose but your self-respect. - Wendelin Van Draanen, Flipped
But I think that because they trusted themselves and respected themselves as individuals, because they knew beyond doubt that they were valuable and potentially moral units -- because of this they could give God their own courage and dignity and then receive it back. Such things have disappeared perhaps because men do not trust themselves anymore, and when that happens there is nothing left except perhaps to find some strong sure man, even though he may be wrong, and to dangle from his coattails. - John Steinbeck, East of Eden
Most of our platitudes notwithstanding, self-deception remains the most difficult deception. The tricks that work on others count for nothing in that very well-lit back alley where one keeps assignation with oneself: no winning smiles will do here, no prettily drawn lists of good intentions. One shuffles flashily but in vain through one's marked cards- the kindness done for the wrong reason, the apparent triumph which involved no real effort, the seemingly heroic act into which one had been shamed. - Joan Didion, Slouching Towards Bethlehem
Stuck in my own trap of writing about a nonsubject, I think I can defend my own self-respect, and also the integrity of a lost girl, by saying two things. First, the trivial doings of Paris Hilton are of no importance to me, or anyone else, and I should not be forced to contemplate them. Second, she should be left alone to lead such a life as has been left to her. If this seems paradoxical, then very well. - Christopher Hitchens
being well and well being is my way of life - Akosua Dardaine Edwards, What Did I Learn Today? Lessons on The Journey to Unconditional Self-Love
These characters depend to such a high degree on their own sense of integrity that for them, victory has nothing to do with happiness. It has more to do with a settling within oneself, a movement inward that makes them whole. Their reward is not happiness...what James's characters gain is self-respect. - Azar Nafisi, Reading Lolita in Tehran
The fact is no one has understood me in entirety till now! - Ramana Pemmaraju
From beggar to thief is one step, but a step in two directions at the same time, for what a beggar loses in morality when he becomes a thief he regains in self-respect. - Angela Carter, Nights at the Circus
I have never consciously boasted myself but from hereon I make a point not to even unconsciously undermine or degrade myself! - Ramana Pemmaraju
What ultimately got me through was my single-minded determination, voiced aloud to myself and recorded in my diary, to discover the causes of my blindness and never to repeat them. Fearlessly pursuing insight was my badge of honor, my route back to self-respect. - Jeanne Safer, The Golden Condom: And Other Essays on Love Lost and Found
Teach people how to treat you - DivineConspiracy
The existence of homosexuality, not as a circumstantial matter of passing sexual whim, but as a shared condition and identity, raises the intriguing possibility of homosexual culture, or at least of a minority subculture with sexual identity as its base. At the very least, by sympathetic identification with cultural texts which appeared to be affirmative, homosexual people saw a way to shore up their self-respect in the face of constant moral attack, and they found materials with which to justify themselves not only to each other but also to those who found their very existence, let alone their behaviour, unjustifiable. - Gregory Woods, A History of Gay Literature: The Male Tradition
Empowered Women 101: A confident woman doesn't have to talk a man into loving her. He either loves her completely, not enough or not at all. Regardless, she doesn't settle for less than she deserves. - Shannon L. Alder
Self-respect cannot be hunted. It cannot be purchased. It is never for sale. It cannot be fabricated out of public relations. It comes to us when we are alone, in quiet moments, in quiet places, when we suddenly realize that, knowing the good, we have done it; knowing the beautiful, we have served it; knowing the truth we have spoken it - Alfred Whitney Griswold
I may not be a king or a queen, but I'll be damned if I'm not treated like royalty. - Samuel Crone
To have that sense of one's intrinsic worth which constitutes self-respect is potentially to have everything: the ability to discriminate, to love and to remain indifferent. To lack it is to be locked within oneself, paradoxically incapable of either love or indifference. If we do not respect ourselves, we are the one hand forced to despise those who have so few resources as to consort with us, so little perception as to remain blind to our fatal weaknesses. On the other, we are peculiarly in thrall to everyone we see, curiously determined to live out â€“ since our self-image is untenable â€“ their false notion of us. We flatter ourselves by thinking this compulsion to please others an attractive trait: a gist for imaginative empathy, evidence of our willingness to give. Of course I will play Francesca to your Paolo, Helen Keller to anyone's Annie Sullivan; no expectation is too misplaced, no role too ludicrous. At the mercy of those we cannot but hold in contempt, we play roles doomed to failure before they are begun, each defeat generating fresh despair at the urgency of divining and meeting the next demand made upon us. - Joan Didion
There is a common superstition that â€œself-respectâ€ is a kind of charm against snakes, something that keeps those who have it locked in some unblighted Eden, out of strange beds, ambivalent conversations, and trouble in general. It does not at all. It has nothing to do with the face of things, but concerns instead a separate peace, a private reconciliation. - Joan Didion, Slouching Towards Bethlehem
Humility is one of the best expressions of self respect. - Debasish Mridha
Look deep into my soul than what stretches the fabric of my clothes - Morgan Chabane
I'll never know why it was important to him that the couple (he said it later that he'd never seen them before) would take a picture of the whole Mr. Johnson back to Little Rock.He must have been tired of being crippled, as prisoners tire of penitentiary bars and the guilty tire of blame. The high topped shoes and the cane, his uncontrollable muscles and thick tongue, and the looks he suffered of either contempt or pity had simply worn him out, and for one afternoon, one part of an afternoon, he wanted no part of them.I understood and felt closer to him at that moment than ever before or since. - Maya Angelou
The dismal fact is that self-respect has nothing to do with the approval of others â€” who are, after all, deceived easily enough; has nothing to do with reputation, which, as Rhett Butler told Scarlett O'Hara, is something people with courage can do without.To do without self-respect, on the other hand, is to be an unwilling audience of one to an interminable documentary that deals with one's failings, both real and imagined, with fresh footage spliced in for every screening. There's the glass you broke in anger, there's the hurt on X's face; watch now, this next scene, the night Y came back from Houston, see how you muff this one. To live without self-respect is to lie awake some night, beyond the reach of warm milk, the Phenobarbital, and the sleeping hand on the coverlet, counting up the sins of commissions and omission, the trusts betrayed, the promises subtly broken, the gifts irrevocably wasted through sloth or cowardice, or carelessness. However long we postpone it, we eventually lie down alone in that notoriously uncomfortable bed, the one we make ourselves. Whether or not we sleep in it depends, of course, on whether or not we respect ourselves. - Joan Didion
There are worse things than suffering and death... it is worse to lose one's self-respect. - SÃ¡ndor MÃ¡rai, Embers
If you're so far down the totem pole that someone considers it a favor to you just to have you in their circle (no matter how far outside the ring you are), you should probably cut them out of yours. - Michelle N. Onuorah
Even if the world was falling apart, that was no reason to let his appearance and good habits fall apart with it. - S.R. Ford, Mimgardr

Why are you drinking? - the little prince asked.- In order to forget - replied the drunkard.- To forget what? - inquired the little prince, who was already feeling sorry for him.- To forget that I am ashamed - the drunkard confessed, hanging his head.- Ashamed of what? - asked the little prince who wanted to help him.- Ashamed of drinking! - concluded the drunkard, withdrawing into total silence.And the little prince went away, puzzled.'Grown-ups really are very, very odd', he said to himself as he continued his journey. - Antoine de Saint-ExupÃ©ry, The Little Prince
One of the causes of unhappiness among intellectuals in the present day is that so many of them, especially those whose skill is literary, find no opportunity for the independent exercise of their talents, but have to hire themselves out to rich corporations directed by Philistines, who insist upon their producing what they themselves regard as pernicious nonsense. If you were to inquire among journalists in either England or America whether they believed in the policy of the newspaper for which they worked, you would find, I believe, that only a small minority do so; the rest, for the sake of a livelihood, prostitute their skill to purposes which they believe to be harmful. Such work cannot bring any real satisfaction, and in the course of reconciling himself to the doing of it, a man has to make himself so cynical that he can no longer derive whole-hearted satisfaction from anything whatever. I cannot condemn men who undertake work of this sort, since starvation is too serious an alternative, but I think that where it is possible to do work that is satisfactory to man's constructive impulses without entirely starving, he will be well advised from the point of view of his own happiness if he chooses it in preference to work much more highly paid but not seeming to him worth doing on its own account. Without self-respect genuine happiness is scarcely possible. And the man who is ashamed of his work can hardly achieve self-respect. - Bertrand Russell

our thoughts have to be accountable to our self - Stefen Dany
Great self-respect is as often manifested in forbearance as in resentment. - E.D.E.N. Southworth, Capitola's Peril
Would 'sorry' have made any difference? Does it ever? It's just a word. One word against a thousand actions. - Sarah Ockler, Bittersweet
Children show scars like medals. Lovers use them as a secrets to reveal. A scar is what happens when the word is made flesh. - Leonard Cohen, The Favorite Game
One of the most difficult things to think about in life is one's regrets. Something will happen to you, and you will do the wrong thing, and for years afterward you will wish you had done something different. - Lemony Snicket, Horseradish: Bitter Truths You Can't Avoid
You can run. You can keep running to the ends of the earth. But I won't be far behind you.â€â€œEthanâ€”â€â€œNo. I will never be far behind you.â€ He tipped up my chin so that I could do nothing else but look back into his eyes. â€œDo the things you need to do. Learn to be a vampire, to be a warrior, to be the soldier you are capable of being. But consider the possibility that I made a mistake I regretâ€”and that I'll continue to regret that mistake and try to convince you to give me another chance until the earth stops turning. - Chloe Neill, Hard Bitten
Nothing has a stronger influence psychologically on their environment and especially on their children than the unlived life of the parent. - C.G. Jung
You were what you were and you are what you are. Fuck that regrets bullshit. - Irvine Welsh, Porno
One day, perhaps, you will see for yourself that regrets are as nothing. The value lies in how they are answered. - Steven Erikson, House of Chains
Whenever you lose someone you love, you have those lingering regrets. You wish you could hug them or kiss them or talk to them...I don't want those regrets - Lisa De Jong, When It Rains
RegretsTiming is irrelevant when two people are meant for each other. It's what I once believed.But we met during a time when I was such a mess, when I still had so much to figure out. How could I have known how crucial every word, every action was or how losing you would be something I would always regret?If only you could have met me now, how different it would be. How much I have changed. How I have grown. I learned so much from all the mistakes I made with you. I just wish I had made them with someone else. - Lang Leav, Lullabies
I dare say there's many a woman makes as sad a mistake as I have done, and only finds it out too late. - Elizabeth Gaskell, North and South
The brave don't live forever but the cautious don't live at all. The only thing that's truly terrifying is the unlived life. - Bill See, 33 Days: Touring In A Van.  Sleeping On Floors.  Chasing A Dream.
Personally of course I regret everything.Not a word, not a deed, not a thought, not a need,not a grief, not a joy, not a girl, not a boy,not a doubt, not a trust, not a scorn, not a lust,not a hope, not a fear, not a smile, not a tear,not a name, not a face, no time, no place...that I do not regret, exceedingly.An ordure, from beginning to end. - Samuel Beckett, Watt
I looked after that Dudley family for too long, over six years. His daddy would take him to the garage and whip him with a rubber hose-pipe trying to beat the girl out a that boy until I couldn't stand it no more.... I wish to God I'd told John Green Dudley he ain't going to hell. That he ain't no sideshow freak cause he like boys. I wish to God I'd filled his ears with good things like I'm trying to do with Mae Mobley. Instead, I just sat in the kitchen, waiting to put the salve on them hose-pipe welts. - Kathryn Stockett, The Help
One hesitates to open a new chapter when the old one is not resolved. - Jude Morgan, Indiscretion
In life, I regret the things I didn't do far more than the missteps I made along the way. - David   Stanley
May posterity show mercy when it look back upon the work we do today. We did what we could with what we had. - Mira Grant, Blackout
Regrets... Regrets are bootless. A vain trick of the mind. An impotent raging against what cannot be changed anyway. A distraction from the moment. - Andrew Ashling, The Invisible Chains - Part 3: Bonds of Blood
As sure as this Earth is turnin, souls burnin / In search of higher learnin, turnin in every direction seeking direction / My moms cryin cause her insides are dyin / Her son tryin her patience, keep her heart racin / A million beats a minute, I know I push you to your limit / But it's this game, loveâ€”I'm caught up all in it / They make it so you can't prevent it, never give it / You gotta take it, can't fake it, I keep it authentic / My hand got this pistol shakin, cause I sense danger / Like Camp Crystal Lake, and / Don't wanna shoot him, but I got him, trapped / Within this infrared dot, bout to hot him and hit rock bottom / No answers to these trick questions, no time shit stressin / My life found I got ta live for the right now / Time waits for no man, can't turn back the hands / Once it's too late, gotta learn to live with regrets - Jay-Z
You're right, Norah, anything can happen, anytime. But what goes wrong isn't your fault. You can't spend the rest of your life tiptoeing around to try and avert disaster. It won't work. You'll just end up missing the life you have. - Kim Edwards, The Memory Keeper's Daughter
It was becoming more and more evident that Salem was a town that celebrated individuality, a real live-and-let-live kind of place. Melody felt a gut punch of regret. Her old nose would have fit in here."Look!" She pointed at the multicolored car whizzing by. Its black door were from a Mercedes coupe, the white hood from a BMW; the silver trunk was Jaguar, the red convertible top was Lexus, the whitewall tires were Bentley, the sound system was Bose, and the music was classical. A hood ornament from each model dangled from the rear view mirror. Its license plate appropriately read MUTT."That car looks like a moving Benton ad.""Or a pileup on Rodeo drive." Candace snapped a picture with her iPhone and e-mailed to her friends back home. They responded instantly with a shot of what they were doing. It must have involved the mall because Candace picked up her pace and began asking anyone under the age of fifty where the cool people hung out. - Lisi Harrison, Monster High

When the minds of men slip from realities to fantasies without thinking of the future consequences, then we must ponder. When the hearts of men are entangled with what though might seem great but yet, specious ambitions without pondering over the resulting footprints, then we ought to take precautions. When the hands of men unwittingly and for the sake of self-gratification find the right weapons and dexterity for the wrong purpose, then massacre and cruelties leave indelible footprints of sorrow and bitterness in the hearts of men. We shall always look back to the footprints of yesterday to say had we know if we don't take a critical look at today's footsteps. There is always an alternative that is better than good - Ernest Agyemang Yeboah

Never played with my unborn niece.Never made amends with my parents and sister since our continued fighting began almost eight months earlier. - Skye Callahan, Irrevocable

What haunts me far more than anything I've ever done are the things I haven't done. - Dan Pearce, Single Dad Laughing
Regrets are particularly poignant for the old, those of us who have used up most of the chances we'll ever get and are left to make peace with our failed choices. Most things distance themselves with space and time to eventually slide off the edge of our consciousness, but not regrets. You can shove them aside, disavow them for a lifetime, but they always return. And the longer you deny them, the more they punish you when they can no longer be held at bay. - Lionel Fisher, Celebrating Time Alone: Stories Of Splendid Solitude
Neglected dreams become regrets. - Stephen Richards, Success is Only One Thought Away: Motivational and Inspirational Quotes from Mind Power Professional Stephen Richards
Dirck's thoughts wandered to Creena. It was a good thing she wasn't there or she'd die, too. He shuddered to think of how she'd feel when she got back and everyone was dead.

Is there such a thing as a life without any regrets? I've never believed so. We spend our lives aiming for happiness and fulfilment in work, in love and with our friends and family, and yet often our energy is spent lamenting bad boyfriends, wrong career turns, fallouts with friends and opportunities missed. Or is that just me? I admit I'm naturally a glass-half-empty kind of girl, but I know regrets are a burden to happiness and I'm trying to let go of them because I've learned that it's all about choice. You can choose to turn regrets into lessons that change your future. Believe me when I say I'm really trying to do this. But the truth is, I'm failing. Because all I can think right now is: maybe I deserve it. Maybe this is my penance. - Ali Harris, The First Last Kiss
Dead ButterflyBy Ellen BassFor months my daughter carried a dead monarch in a quart mason jar. To and from school in her backpack, to her only friend's house. At the dinner table it sat like a guest alongside the pot roast. She took it to bed, propped by her pillow. Was it the year her brother was born? Was this her own too-fragile baby that had livedâ€”so brieflyâ€”in its glassed world? Or the year she refused to go to her father's house? Was this the holding-her-breath girl she became there? This plump child in her rolled-down socks I sometimes wanted to haul back inside me and carry safe again. What was her fierce commitment? I never understood. We just lived with the dead winged thing as part of her, as part of us, weightless in its heavy jar. - Ellen Bass

As much as he loathed himself for it, he couldn't stop thinking about Abigail. If he hadn't met her, he might be married to someone else. Some nice woman who didn't throw dishes at him. He'd be asleep right now, lying on his side with her warm body snuggled up against his chest, and their children--yes, he was quite sure there would have been two or three of them--would be sound asleep in the next room dreaming of sugarplums or whatever kids dreamed about. If he hadn't met Abigail, he certainly wouldn't be stuffed like a slab of meat in the back of a car with his own executioners. - J.S. Bailey, Rage's Echo
I was watching when the Enforcers arrived. I saw them go into Rosa's. There were so many I'd never have gotten close enough to do anything. I could hear them talking about what they'd do to you as they went in and I thought I'd lost you.â€ His palm presses against my cheek, stroking away stray strands of hair, â€œEve, I've never been so scared. The thought that I'd never get to see you again, to apologise for the way I treated you, I couldn't bear it. When they dragged you out I was so relieved, knowing that I had a chance to get you back.â€ He squeezes me tightly against his body as he admits, â€œI can't lose you Eve. Them taking you made everything so clear. I love you and I thought I wasn't going to get the chance to prove how much. I couldn't let that happen. - Angela Louise McGurk, Absolution

Regret is the sound of the ghosts of our own making. I will live with mine until I die. - T.A. Webb
Always regret the things you did do, never the things you didn't. - Dorothy Koomson, The Cupid Effect
I lay on the bed and shut my eyes, thinking that nobody really likes marriage, that it's a flawed arrangement, that people get enthusiastic and jump in for a hundred reasons and then, after the ceremony, after a few years, the whole deal turns into a concert they wouldn't have dreamed of attending. - Frederick Barthelme, Elroy Nights

I saw myself.... In the time I watched, I saw strengthâ€”and frailty. Pride and vanity, courage and fear. Of wisdom, a little. Of folly, much. Of intentions, many good ones; but many more left undone. In this, alas, I saw myself a man like any other. But this, too, I saw.... Alike as men may seem, each is different as flakes of snow, no two the same. You told me you had no need to seek the Mirror, knowing you were Annlaw Clay-Shaper. Now I know who I am: myself and none other. I am Taran. - Lloyd Alexander, Taran Wanderer

In the months after the relationship ends, a person can seem to grow at a lightning rate, like in a nature documentary where weeks of footage is run at high speed to show a plant unfurling in seconds, but in reality the person has been growing all along, under the surface, and it is only in their new freedom, in their hair-raising aloneness, that the person can allow for these underground things to break through and unfurl themselves in the light. - Nicole Krauss, Forest Dark

Why has no one come to pry me out of here?- Cersei - George R.R. Martin, A Feast for Crows
I spent a long time in the study of the abstract sciences, and was disheartened by the small number of fellow-students in them. When I commenced the study of man, I saw that these abstract sciences are not suited to man, and that I was wandering further from my own state in examining them, than others in not knowing them. I pardoned their little knowledge; but I thought at least to find many companions in the study of man, and that it was the true study which is suited to him. I have been deceived; still fewer study it than geometry. It is only from want of knowing how to study this that we seek the other studies. But is it not that even here is not the knowledge which man should have, and that for the purposes of happiness it is better for him not to know himself? - Pascal
The curve of man's knowledge of himself ascends until the 17th century, declines gradually afterwards, in this century it finally plummets - NicolÃ¡s GÃ³mez DÃ¡vila

There is pleasure in reading a version of myself I know in my heart could never exist, since mine is not an iron mind coldly calculating every possible option and outcome. Instead I am a businessman who loves excitement, loves tension, loves risk and the unexpected, and just happens to possess an extraordinary, on occasion even miraculous, degree of good luck. - Jacob Wren, Rich and Poor
Our spirits rose after a few beers, all that lay between us during the day, the silences that could develop from nowhere, the irritation that could set in, the sudden inability to find areas of common interest, even though there were so many, all of that vanished as our spirits soared and we felt the concomitant warmth: we looked at each other and knew who we were. - Knausgaard, Karl Ove
Life so far seemed like a kind of dance to him, and he was pleased to discover that he was pretty good at it. Lf there was something hollow underneath it all, a well of fear that sometimes seemed to pull everything else into it and leave him clutching the stone rim for fear of falling into himself, well, that was part of being human, he supposed. That's what the booze was for. - Nathan Ballingrud, The Visible Filth

...[T]he whole undertaking of philosophical inquiry requires a prior understanding of the conceptual system in which the undertaking is set. That is an empirical job for cognitive science and cognitive semantics. ... Unless this job is done, we will not know whether the answers philosophers give to their questions are a function of the conceptualization built into the questions themselves. - George Lakoff, Philosophy in the Flesh: The Embodied Mind and its Challenge to Western Thought
The knowledge of ourselves, therefore, is not only an incitement to seek after God, but likewise a considerable assistance towards finding him. - John Calvin, A Compend of the Institutes of the Christian Religion
The greatest of empires, is the empire over one's self. - Publilius Syrus
How was I to be a scientist, father Lion?' Science is knowing. What could I have known? Others always did the knowing, knew what was in me, what should come out of me, what was best for me. I didn't know who I was, what I wanted. I know less now, and I am afraid. - Russell Hoban, The Lion of Boaz-Jachin and Jachin-Boaz

Applicants for wisdomdo what I have done:inquire within - Heraclitus, Fragments
Without self-knowledge you have no root in yourselves personally; you may endure for a time, but under affliction or persecution your faith will not last. This is why many in this age (and in every age) become infidels, heretics, schismatics, disloyal despisers of the Church. They cast off the form of truth, because it never has been to them more than a form. They endure not, because they never have tasted that the Lord is gracious; and they never have had experience of His power and love, because they have never known their own weakness and need. - John Henry Newman, Parochial and Plain Sermons [Complete]
I believe I'm very normal. I'm hyper-normal. I'm more normal than anyone else I know. I think my thoughts, my indulgences, my desires, my pleasures may at first appear different, but that is only because they are more normal, not because they are more esoteric.I believe I am bored when other people are bored, only faster. I am interested when others are interested, only more interested. But I also think I'm less, rather than more, intelligent than other people.By indulging my interests through my life, and perhaps because of rather than despite many failures, I have been able to design my life. - Richard Saul Wurman, Information Anxiety 2

Tobin," Mom said disapprovingly. She wasn't a particularly funny person. It suited her professionally - I mean, you don't want your cancer surgeon to walk into the examination room and be like, "Guy walks into a bar. Bartender says, 'What'll ya have?' And the guy says, 'Whaddya got?' And the bartender says, 'I don't know what I got, but I know what you got: Stage IV melanoma. - John Green, Let It Snow: Three Holiday Romances

Man, it was a good thing vampires didn't get cancer. Lately he'd been chain-smoking like a felon. - J.R. Ward, Lover Unbound
Cancer seems a high price to pay for an innocuous-looking habit. You get into smoking and you are robbed of the last 25 years of your life. Some cocky souls will say, 'Ah yes, but they are the worst 25 years.' Nobody feels like that in a cancer ward. There are no cocky souls in a cancer ward. But there's a lot of pain, not just of the excruciating physical kind that they shoot you full of morphine to smother. There are a lot of tears. All round. It is hard to say goodbye to the people you love. And it's scary. Cancer wards have a way of knocking the cockiness out of you. And for what? Another cigarette? - Tony Parsons

It's like they say about soldiers coming back from war. People all around you are dying. Really dying, Eric. You go in for a week's chemotherapy and you're in a ward with people who are really, actually dying, there and then and doing their best to come to terms with it. When the week's up, you go home and you see your family and your friends and everything's normal and familiar. It's too much. You think - one world can't possibly hold both these lives and you feel like you're going to go crazy when you realise the world is that big and it can fill with the most terrible things whenever it wants to. - Steven Hall, The Raw Shark Texts
It was Disney World fused with Cancerland. - Siddhartha Mukherjee, The Emperor of All Maladies: A Biography of Cancer

Everest attempt at sixty-two, three weeks after undergoing surgery for kidney cancer, marathon des Sables six months after it was amputated fingers and toes, be measured by the diagonal of Fools four weeks after ablation of a metastasis to the lung, is this possible? Cancer does not stop your life, giving up your dreams or your goals, it is simply a parameter to manage, no more, no less than all the other parameters of life.How to ensure that the disease becomes transparent to you and your entourage, almost insignificant in terms of trip you want to accomplish? This is precisely the question that Gerard Bourrat tries to answer in this book. To make a sports performance, to live with her cancer, to live well with amputations, the path is always the same: a goal, the joy of effort, perseverance and faith.This book does not commit you to climb Everest, to run under a blazing sun, walking thousands of miles, it invites you to conquer your own Everest. - GÃ©rard Bourrat, L'Ã©verest, Le Cancer, La Vie
Apple and apricot seeds contain a vitamin called B12, which I found to be illegal to sell in pharmacies. Now, this is very interesting. You can buy all kind of vitamins in pharmacies, but not B12. Why in the hell would the pharmaceutical industry make a vitamin that we can eat on our own, through seeds, illegal? I asked this question to employees in the pharmacies and many doctors, and they couldn't answer. They just kept looking at me as if I was trying to get ingredients to make my own synthetic drugs. For most people, what is illegal is really illegal. Most people are too stupid to think for themselves, even when my question is so obvious that they seem to have brain damage not to realize the relevance of such question. - Robin Sacredfire
For all malignant cancers, both fish eaters and vegetarians and vegans combined had significantly lower mortality than regular meat eaters [HR: 0.76 (95% CI: 0.63, 0.91) and HR: 0.82 (95% CI: 0.72, 0.94), respectively]. Vegetarians and vegans combined also had significantly lower mortality than did regular meat eaters for pancreatic cancer [HR: 0.47 (95% CI: 0.26, 0.86); P-heterogeneity = 0.065] and cancers of the lymphatic/hematopoietic tissue [HR: 0.43 (95% CI: 0.27, 0.70)], and low meat eaters had significantly lower respiratory disease mortality than regular meat eaters [HR: 0.69 (95% CI: 0.49, 0.97); P-heterogeneity = 0.14]. - Paul Appleby
For specific causes of death, compared with regular meat eaters, low meat eaters had ~30â€“45% lower mortality from pancreatic cancer, respiratory disease, and all other causes of death, fish eaters had ~20% lower mortality from malignant cancer and ~20% higher circulatory disease mortality, and vegetarians and vegans had ~50% lower mortality from pancreatic cancer and cancers of the lymphatic/ hematopoietic tissue. These findings were essentially unchanged on further adjustment for BMI, and generally were robust across categories of sex, smoking, and BMI for the 6 most common causes of death. - Paul Appleby
There is general agreement that red meat consumption increases the risk of colon or colorectal cancer. This was the only food association with cancer that was labeled â€˜â€˜convincing'' in the recent report from the World Cancer Research Fund, American Institute for Cancer Research (42). The evidence, of course, largely came from studies of meat consumption in nonvegetarians, although data from Adventist vegetarians in California concur (43). - Gary E. Fraser
Although protein deficiency is widespread in poverty-stricken communities and in some nonindustrialized countries, most people in industrialized countries face the opposite problemâ€”protein excess. The RDA for a 70-kilogram (154-pound) person is 56 grams; however, the average American man consumes approximately 100 grams of protein daily, and the average woman about 70 grams. Many meat-loving Americans eat far more protein. Some research suggests that high protein intake contributes to risk for heart disease, cancer, and osteoporosis. However, because high protein intake often goes hand-in-hand with high intakes of saturated fat and cholesterol, the independent effects of high protein intake are difficult to determine. - Melissa Bernstein, Nutrition
Diverging results for types of dairy products and sources of calcium suggest that other components of dairy than fat and calcium may increase prostate cancer risk. Additional prospective studies are needed on types of dairy products and various sources of calcium in relation to risk of subtypes of prostate cancer and, in particular, advanced and fatal cancers. - Dagfinn Aune
In contrast to the positive associations for total and dietary calcium, there was no association with intake of nondairy calcium. This result might have suggested that other components of dairy products than calcium contribute to [prostrate cancer] risk. - Dagfinn Aune
I am reminded of an image...that living with a terminal disease is like walking on a tightrope over an insanely scary abyss. But that living without disease is also like walking on a tightrope over an insanely scary abyss, only with some fog or cloud cover obscuring the depths a bit more -- sometimes the wind blowing it off a little, sometimes a nice dense cover. - Nina Riggs, The Bright Hour: A Memoir of Living and Dying
He put the x-ray up on the light screen: The tumor was a large white circle in the middle of the picture. It looked like a headlight coming straight at me, full-speed ahead. - Mike Lingenfelter, The Angel by My Side: The True Story of a Dog Who Saved a Man...and a Man Who Saved a Dog

But that's the thing about cancer. They call it the fight, as if the stronger ones win and the weaker ones lose, but that's not what cancer is at all. Cancer isn't one of the players in the game. Cancer is the game. It doesn't matter how much endurance you have. It doesn't matter how much you've practiced. Cancer is the be-all and end-all of the sport, and the only thing you can do is show up to the game with your jersey on. Because you never know... you might be forced to sit the bench for the entire game. You may not even be given the chance to compete. - Colleen Hoover, November 9
Bitterness is the cancer of bones. - Lailah Gifty Akita
I'm not scared of death, Dad,â€ I told him. â€œI'm scared of not living. I don't want to die with any regrets that I didn't get to do the things in life that I've always wanted. - Amanda Maxlyn, What's Left of Me
We're not dead yet, so don't talk to us like we're about to be. - Amanda Maxlyn, What's Left of Me
I just want it to stop. All of it. The pain. The suffering. The fucking cancer. I want it gone. I need it gone, Jean. It's tearing me apart inside. God, I hate this. Even all the lying I'm doing to Parker. It's breaking my heart. - Amanda Maxlyn, What's Left of Me
I was pissed that I couldn't go out and celebrate like someone turning twenty-one typically would, so I wore black hair to show my family just how pissed off I was. - Amanda Maxlyn, What's Left of Me
You don't need to be someone you're not. Haven't you learned that? Stop being scared and face the world. I know you're not in remission yet, but who can say they have been through cancer twice and beat it? Confront the world, Aundrea. You're alive. Be proud of the strong woman you are and stop hiding behind your wig. - Amanda Maxlyn, What's Left of Me
When a disease insinuates itself so potently into the imagination of an era, it is often because it impinges on an anxiety latent within that imagination. AIDS loomed so large on the 1980s in part because this was a generation inherently haunted by its sexuality and freedom; SARS set off a panic about global spread and contagion at a time when globalism and social contagion were issues simmering nervously in the West. Every era casts illness in its own image. Society, like the ultimate psychosomatic patient, matches its medical afflictions to its psychological crises; when a disease touches such a visceral chord, it is often because that chord is already resonating. - Siddhartha Mukherjee, The Emperor of All Maladies: A Biography of Cancer
The worst part about cancer isn't what it does to you, but what it does to the people you love. - Deadpool
Democracy is cancerous, and bureaus are its cancer. A bureau takes root anywhere in the state, turns malignant like the Narcotic Bureau, and grows and grows, always reproducing more of its own kind, until it chokes the host if not controlled or excised. Bureaus cannot live without a host, being true parasitic organisms. (A cooperative on the other hand can live without the state. That is the road to follow. The building up of independent units to meet needs of the people who participate in the functioning of the unit. A bureau operates on opposite principles of inventing needs to justify its existence.) Bureaucracy is wrong as a cancer, a turning away from the human evolutionary direction of infinite potentials and differentiation and independent spontaneous action to the complete parasitism of a virus. (It is thought that the virus is a degeneration from more complex life-form. It may at one time have been capable of independent life. Now has fallen to the borderline between living and dead matter. It can exhibit living qualities only in a host, by using the life of another â€” the renunciation of life itself, a falling towards inorganic, inflexible machine, towards dead matter.) Bureaus die when the structure of the state collapse. They are as helpless and unfit for independent existence as a displaced tapeworm, or a virus that has killed the host. - William S. Burroughs, Naked Lunch
You gave me a forever within the numbered days and I'm grateful. - John Green, The Fault in Our Stars
The thing about cancer is that it can always exceed your worst expectations. There is something pornographic about cancer's ability to confound your imagination. Whatever new obscenity cancer comes up with to torment and torture you, it can always do worse tomorrow. - Tony Parsons

E.M. Ashford: And death shall be no more" comma "death, thou shalt die." Nothing but a breath, a comma separates life from life everlasting.E.M. Ashford: Very simple, really. With the original punctuation restored Death is no longer something to act out on a stage with exclamation marks. It is a comma. A pause.E.M. Ashford: In this way, the uncompromising way one learns something from the poem, wouldn't you say? Life, death, soul, God, past present. Not insuperable barriers. Not semi-colons. Just a comma. - Margaret Ebson

Cancer though, it was a fickle friend that didn't care about your age, gender or race. It would move in take up residence and eventually kick you to the curb, it was a mean landlord and didn't care who it hurt in order to get what it wanted. - Ella Frank, Exquisite

Emma shut her laptop and scowled at them. â€œI'm pink.â€She wasn't sure when her opinion of the color changed or why, but she now took offense to outsiders putting down the pink as much as she took offense to corporations abusing the color. What she once criticized she now understood. Despite all the exploitation, there was something intangible behind the pink, a sense of connectedness, and she wanted to embrace that camaraderie. - Lydia Michaels, La Vie en Rose: Life in Pink

Sickness usually dominates the thoughts of a patient with cancer, but too much preoccupation with illness can have a destructive effect on the mind, and knowing what can happen frequently becomes self-fulfilling. Today, people who are ill will spend hours surfing the internet to find out all they can about their illness â€“ but this isn't always a good thing. - Jennifer Worth, In the Midst of Life
He walked across the room and flicked a switch. A spotlight turned on, illuminating a laminated poster of a woman on his wall. He took a crayon from his pocket and began drawing on it. I could see smudges from past demonstrations. [. . .] His dashed lines crisscrossed the woman's chest as if he were planning a military maneuver on undulating terrain. - Kim van Alkemade, Orphan Number Eight
According to accepted newspaper clichÃ©s, we all go down fighting. The other day I even read that an 18-month-old baby had died after a long battle with cancer. That has become the mandatory phrase for all who expire, disease-ridden. They battled valiantly; they lost. When I finally depart I hope somebody will write, instead, that I died after a long battle with life. - Pierre Berton
Seventy-six for an American male was a number on an actuarial chart that includes men who are obese, smokers and inheritors of deadly family genes. - Tom Brokaw, A Lucky Life Interrupted: A Memoir of Hope
Maintaining the thinnest facade of a functioning family that tries to act as others do - plan ahead, drive somewhere, go on holiday, relax - is beyond us. We are smashed. Insecurity jams the gears on every action. Each time we are toppled. I feel a fool over and over again for trying. - Marion Coutts
These are the dilemmas for cancer patients. Who and what to believe? A particular treatment is not foolproof, or as many medical experts remind us, is not math, with a fixed and certain outcome. - Tom Brokaw
Is that cancer curable or just treatable. - Tom Brokaw, A Lucky Life Interrupted: A Memoir of Hope
She wished she had cancer instead. She'd trade Alzheimer's for cancer in a heartbeat. She felt ashamed for wishing this, and it was certainly a pointless bargaining, but she permitted herself the fantasy anyway. With cancer, she'd have something to fight. There was surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. There was the chance that she could win. Her family and the community at Harvard would rally behind her battle and consider it noble. And even if it defeated her in the end, she'd be able to look them knowingly in the eye and say good-bye before she left. - Lisa Genova, Still Alice

Hormonal changes permanently alter the breast's structure. And when a pregnancy is terminated through abortion, the process is interrupted, which leaves cells in a sate of transition.

I'm not one of those people who think that cancer is some kind of jousting match. People live or die based on good medicine, good luck, and the grace of God. The people that die from it did not fail. The people who live will die another day. - Paul Acampora, I Kill the Mockingbird
So what did you do when death came to your house? We continued in the same way as before. What is that, a failure of the imagination? Are you in denial?

Almost all the world is natural chemicals, so it really makes you re-think everything. A cup of coffee is filled with chemicals. They've identified a thousand chemicals in a cup of coffee. But we only found 22 that have been tested in animal cancer tests out of this thousand. And of those, 17 are carcinogens. There are ten milligrams of known carcinogens in a cup of coffee and thats more carcinogens than you're likely to get from pesticide residues for a year! - Bruce Ames

Initially, after David's diagnosis, I would cringe when I readbooks or articles by cancer survivors who stated that cancer hadbeen a gift in their lives. How could all that David endured beviewed as a gift? The invasive surgery, the weeks of chemotherapyand radiation: a gift?Yet, after the cancer, David would often reach for my hand andsay, â€œIf it is cancer that is responsible for our new relationship, thenit was all worth it.â€ And I'd reluctantly agree that cancer had been agift in our lives. We'd both seen the other alternative: patients andsurvivors who had become bitter and angry, and neither one of uswanted to become that. - Mary Potter Kenyon, Chemo-Therapist: How Cancer Cured a Marriage

Breast cancer, I can now report, did not make me prettier or stronger, more feminine or spiritual. What it gave me, if you want to call this a â€œgift,â€ was a very personal, agonizing encounter with an ideological force in American culture that I had not been aware of beforeâ€”one that encourages us to deny reality, submit cheerfully to misfortune, and blame only ourselves for our fate. - Barbara Ehrenreich, Bright-Sided: How the Relentless Promotion of Positive Thinking Has Undermined America

In an essay titled A View From the Front Line, Jencks described her experience with cancer as like being woken up midflight on a jumbo jet and then thrown out with a parachute into a foreign landscape without a map:"There you are, the future patient, quietly progressing with other passengers toward a distant destination when, astonishingly (Why me?) a large hole opens in the floor next to you. People in white coats appear, help you into a parachute and â€” no time to think â€” out you go."You descend. You hit the ground....But where is the enemy? What is the enemy? What is it up to?...No road. No compass. No map. No training. Is there something you should know and don't?"The white coats are far, far away, strapping others into their parachutes. Occasionally they wave but, even if you ask them, they don't know the answers. They are up there in the Jumbo, involved with parachutes, not map-making. - Siddhartha Mukherjee, The Emperor of All Maladies: A Biography of Cancer
Because really, what do you have to lose? Your life? That's no big deal, I promise you. When you find out you might die, you're finally allowed to live like you never have before. If you lose your life while living the shit out of it, then you've done the best you could, and you shouldn't worry about death. When you're dead, you can't screw up. But while you're here, all you have are a few things to call your own. You have your integrity, your family, and your hope for the future. These are important and you should keep them somewhere safe where you'll remember them. - Kevin Lankes
I've learned so much during my time with cancer. It's taught me a lot about who I am. It revealed to me my true goals and priorities. It introduced me to a brand new world where time isn't wasted, and important things aren't left unsaid. All the while, the superfluities of life are ignored and forgotten. Because I now understand how a person should act, whether confronted by death or not. And it's a shame that's what it takes to scare someone into becoming a conducive, meritable human being. - Kevin Lankes
